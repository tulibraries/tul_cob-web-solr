        "description": "<h2>Donating general collection materials</h2>\r\n<p>Gifts of books and other library materials can be of great value in adding to our collection useful titles that were never purchased, or replacing lost titles that are no longer in print. If you would like to donate materials for the general collections, please contact Brian Schoolar in Acquisitions &amp; Collection Development at <a href=\"mailto:jbrian@temple.edu\">jbrian@temple.edu</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Donating archival materials</h2>\r\n<p>To donate archival, rare, or special collection materials, or items documenting the history of Temple University, please send a description to Margery Sly at <a href=\"mailto:%20msly@temple.edu\">msly@temple.edu</a>. The University Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) Research Center welcomes inquiries about potential donations of books, documents, organizational records, photographs, and other materials that complement our research collections. We will work with you to determine the most appropriate disposition of the material and to conclude a donation agreement.</p>\r\n<h2>Donating to the Health Sciences Libraries</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Health Sciences Libraries accept gifts of current, relevant titles that have not been previously purchased or that replace lost titles of value to the collection.</li>\r\n<li>The Health Sciences Libraries require a list of material titles, including publication dates, prior to the donation. </li>\r\n<li>Gift materials added to the collection are integrated into the Library’s general collection. Specially designated areas are not available to house gift materials.  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Items we do not accept</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>brittle or damaged materials, unless very rare</li>\r\n<li>paperback novels</li>\r\n<li>textbooks (exceptions: 1) Current textbooks at the Health Sciences Libraries, 2) those published by Temple faculty)</li>\r\n<li>journals or periodicals (except in complete runs of titles not already duplicated)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Tax deductibility &amp; valuation of gifts</h2>\r\n<p>You will receive an acknowledgement that you can use for tax purposes. </p>\r\n<p>The following guidelines apply if the donor intends to claim the fair market value of his/her gift as a charitable deduction for tax purposes: </p>\r\n<p>The Tax Reform Act of 1984 established three categories of tangible property gifts, each having certain requirements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>gifts valued at $500 or less may be claimed as itemized deductions on your 1040 return, schedule A</li>\r\n<li>gifts valued at more than $500 but less than $5,000 must be reported on Part A of IRS form 8283</li>\r\n<li>gifts valued at more than $5,000 require additional information, including an independent third-party appraisal, to be reported on Part B of IRS form 8283 which must also be signed by a representative of Temple University as the recipient of your donation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Whatever the valuation category, it is the responsibility of the donor to establish the fair market value of a gift, either through personal research or with the services of an appraiser. Temple University cannot provide monetary appraisals of donated material or pay for such appraisals due to IRS regulations. If you wish to have a gift appraised, we can offer a list of reputable independent appraisers whom you may contact directly. </p>\r\n<p>Once accepted, your gift becomes the property of the Temple University Libraries. If any materials are ultimately not added to the collections, we reserve the right to dispose of the material as necessary through exchange, sale, or other means. </p>\r\n<h2>Forms &amp; helpful links</h2>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8283.pdf\">IRS form 8283</a></p>",

Gifts made to name specific spaces - <strong>starting at $10,000</strong> - will be applied, unless otherwise specified or requested, to the Library Endowment, which supports regularly scheduled operational needs and opportunities as they arise. What is more, your named gift will be linked to this extraordinary building in perpetuity. While we are seeking gifts to name spaces within the new Charles Library, <strong>gifts of any size</strong> toward an endowment is truly an investment in the present and future of the library, as it provides ongoing support that benefits current and future generations of students, scholars, faculty, staff, and community members. </p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Endowment Spending and Investment</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The monies in this endowment are invested for long-term stability and growth and are spent at a rate of 4.25% per year. This allows the Libraries to steadily maintain and enhance facilities, continue purchasing and preserving materials and collections, attract and retain high-quality faculty and staff, and support evolving technology and innovation. By naming a space or fund, your gift provides long-term value as a steady and growing source of income for the Libraries.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Planned Giving</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can secure your legacy and commitment to this project with cash gifts—made in a single contribution or over a period of up to five years—or through an array of planned giving vehicles. Wills, trusts, estate plans, annuities, retirement funds, and beneficiary designations are just a few of the ways to make a long-term, planned gift. Additionally, many planned giving options are income-bearing, benefiting you, your family, and the future of Temple University Libraries.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mx5BF2sCd-P0M73C8sd6KJaRyAgo6B7C/view?usp=sharing\">Click here to view a full list of naming opportunities - starting at $10,000</a></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Additional Giving Opportunities</strong></h3>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Endowment Giving</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"color: #a50030;\"><strong>Technology Endowment, $1,000,000</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Though flexibility and futurecasting guide the building’s technology planning, the extensive equipment, interfaces, and tools throughout require continued assessment, monitoring, and maintenance. The Technology Endowment supports upgrades and routine work on both transformative, large-scale, operational technologies, like the BookBot and Digital Display Wall, and the multitude of smaller-scale, user-facing materials such as work stations, graduate and faculty studios, and makerspaces.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #a50030;\"><strong>Digital Preservation Endowment, $500,000</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital preservation greatly increases the discovery and use-value of the Libraries’ unique special collections by making them available via the web. It also extends the life of physical and material resources by reducing the frequency with which they are handled. The Digital Preservation Endowment ensures the promise of the library’s onsite, state-of-the-art conservation and digitization labs, and enables the Libraries to continue to scan materials and catalog and mount digital objects to both the Libraries’ website and the Digital Public Library of America.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #a50030;\"><strong>Exhibition Endowment, $500,000</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This fund ensures the promise of both the special programs gallery and the dedicated Special Collections Research Center display area through the purchase of high-quality exhibition cases, mounts, and other specialized furnishings and equipment. This gift will help to build an in-house stock of materials to stage and prepare exhibitions of varying forms, formats, and mediums, and to schedule traveling exhibitions and expand the Libraries’ interpretive program as the opportunity arises.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #a50030;\"><strong>Library Innovation Endowment, $500,000</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This building is forward-looking and designed to foster innovation over the long term through highly flexible spaces and a technologically rich environment. It is not possible, however, to foresee every potential transformation in scholarly and creative output. This fund ensures that the Libraries can take advantage of exciting projects and new opportunities as they arise.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #a50030;\"><strong>Public Program Endowment, $500,000</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The central library’s event and gallery spaces are the first dedicated programming areas at the university’s central library. The Public Program Endowment will supplement operational budget allocations, hence ensuring lively, timely, and high-quality events, exhibitions, lectures, workshops, screenings, and performances at the library.</p>\r\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>One Time Gifts</strong></h4>\r\n<p style=\"color: #a50030;\"><strong>Class Gifts, $100,000</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reunion and class gifts of $100,000 and over may be applied to any naming or funding opportunity available for the library building. Classes may make either endowed or one-time gifts. Visit alumni.temple.edu or giving.temple.edu for more information on how to organize a class gift.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #a50030;\"><strong>Exhibition Cases, $50,000 each</strong></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furnishings, supplies, and specialized equipment are purchased during preparation and building phases of the library project. A variety of high quality, permanent exhibition cases are needed to outfit both the Special Collections Research Center and the First Floor Exhibition Space. A one-time, non-endowed, cash gift of $50,000 will purchase and name an exhibition case. Donors may purchase and name more than one case.</p>",

        "description": "<h2>Temple University Libraries Annual Report <br>Fiscal Years 2016-2017</h2>\r\n<h3>About the Libraries</h3>\r\n<p>Temple University Libraries serve as trusted keepers of the intellectual and cultural record–collecting, describing, providing access to, and preserving a broad universe of materials, including physical and digital collections, rare and unique books, manuscripts, archives, ephemera and the products of scholarly enterprise at Temple. We are committed to providing research and learning services, to providing open access to our facilities and information resources, and to fostering innovation and experimentation. The Libraries serve Temple's students, researchers, teachers and neighbors on Main, Center City and Health Sciences Center campuses in Philadelphia and on our Ambler and Harrisburg campuses.</p>\r\n<h4>Dean of University Libraries</h4>\r\n<p>Joseph Lucia</p>\r\n<h4>Editor</h4>\r\n<p>Beckie Dashiell</p>\r\n<h4>Designer</h4>\r\n<p>Rachel Cox</p>\r\n<h4>Department of Library External Affairs and Advancement</h4>\r\n<p><a href=\"dwash@temple.edu\">dwash@temple.edu</a></p>\r\n<p>Visit our website at library.temple.edu</p>\r\n<h3>Contents</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Note from the Dean</li>\r\n<li>The Evolution of Temple University Libraries</li>\r\n<li>Collection Building, Community Engagement, and New Publications</li>\r\n<li>History of Temple University Libraries</li>\r\n<li>Librarian-Faculty Partnerships: A Collaboration Story</li>\r\n<li>Major News Round Up</li>\r\n<li>The First P2L Summit: What We Learned</li>\r\n<li>Day-to-Day with DPLA and PA Digital</li>\r\n<li>TUL By the Numbers</li>\r\n<li>Looking Ahead: The Future of Temple University Libraries</li>\r\n<li>Staff Accomplishments</li>\r\n<li>Support the Libraries</li>\r\n<li>Honor Roll of Donors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Note from the Dean</h3>\r\n<p>Dear friends,</p>\r\n<p>I am pleased to present you with Temple University Libraries' first-ever annual report, which chronicles our portfolio of accomplishments over the past two fiscal years (July 2015–June 2017) and the ongoing evolution of our library enterprise.</p>\r\n<p>Libraries are fundamental social and cultural institutions, and there is today a renewed sense of their relevance as vital environments for learning, exploration, and the creation of new knowledge. This is especially evident at Temple, as we work to realize our vision for the 21st century academic library from the ground up, with the construction of our new central library.</p>\r\n<p>Yet, our broader vision recognizes that a library is not simply an inert structure–it is defined by the people in it and the activities that take place therein. We look forward to evolving our important, unique work as an academic library and intellectual center for our community, as we support and reflect Temple's essential commitments as an urban research university to education and scholarship, community engagement, diversity, and making learning accessible.</p>\r\n<p>As we continue to grow and transform, our staff remains committed to providing fundamental services, steadily expanding and sharing our collections, engaging our communities, and supporting and publishing high-caliber scholarly work. This report highlights these ongoing and growing efforts, in addition to major news stories and accomplishments, statistics and assessment in action, the professional development work our library staff engage in, and the generous support provided by our donors and friends over the past two years.</p>\r\n<p>At this important moment for the Libraries, we also pause and recognize our beginnings and continual growth, which is visually represented on our history timeline. I hope you will join me in celebrating the Libraries' vibrant past, present, and future.</p>\r\n<p>With warm regards,</p>\r\n<p>Joe Lucia<br>Dean of University Libraries</p>\r\n<h3>The Evolution of Temple University Libraries</h3>\r\n<p>The story of Temple University Libraries begins in 1892. Inside a row house on Park Avenue, faculty, students, and friends created our first library with donations from their own book collections. Since then, the Libraries have undergone constant evolution: expanding resources, opening new locations and spaces, cultivating unique special collections, developing vital services, and embracing emerging technologies. You can view this storied history, along with our continuing transformation, on our History of Temple University Libraries timeline (pp. 6-15).</p>\r\n<h4>A library is about its people and community</h4>\r\n<p>Over the past two years, the Libraries have hired over 30 staff members to fill both crucial vacancies and new, strategically developed positions. Some of these new positions enhance capacity for digitization and digital projects, such as mobile applications and online discovery modules. Other new positions report across departmental lines and strengthen intraorganizational cooperation, such as the Library Publishing and Scholarly Communications Specialist, who works across the Libraries and Temple University Press. The Libraries have also created opportunities for emerging leaders, launching a Council for Library and Information Resources Fellowship and two-year librarian residencies for promising, early-career professionals.</p>\r\n<p>We have also continued to evolve services for students, faculty, and community members, as we work to increasingly optimize the user experience, efficiently connect patrons with the help they need, and provide open access to our facilities and resources. Recent developments include increased public computing stations for our neighbors and an expanded suite of research consultation services. And, in order to best serve our communities, we have developed a culture of assessment to measure our work, our effectiveness, and our progress.</p>\r\n<h4>Connecting with and deepening the academic mission of the university</h4>\r\n<p>The Libraries play a vital role in supporting and extending the university's academic mission. Our growing Special Collections bring our unique, rare materials to life in the learning environment. The Libraries' subject librarians have become progressively active members of the teaching and learning community and have implemented new consultation and outreach initiatives. And, our robust Beyond the Page public programming series has provided a host of educational and cultural experiences for our patrons.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the Libraries increasingly value accessibility and openness. We offer our patrons on- and off-campus access to an expanding number of journals, databases, and eBooks, as we also advocate for the sharing of information, access without barriers, and the use of open textbooks. And, together with Temple University Press, we are evolving our role in scholarly communications at Temple.</p>\r\n<p>The Press has been embedded within the Libraries since 2010, and the past two fiscal years have brought that collaboration into sharper focus. With a strong reputation as a prominent voice for socially engaged scholarship, the Press is a leading publisher of books in the social sciences and the humanities, as well as books about Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley region. Most recently and under the direction of Dean Joe Lucia, the Press and Libraries have worked on joint strategic planning to best employ each other's strengths and support preserving, disseminating, providing access to, and publishing scholarly work.</p>\r\n<p>For example, the newly created Library Publishing and Scholarly Communications Specialist role has allowed the Press and Libraries to work together to leverage shared skills to support the scholarly communication needs of Temple students and faculty. And, with a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Libraries and Press hosted the first-ever Publishers Reporting to Libraries (P2L) Summit, which places us at the forefront of press-library collaborations.</p>\r\n<p>Our work has also encompassed a multitude of other fluid, collaborative projects. From our formative work in creating PA Digital as the Commonwealth's contribution to the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), to our library publishing initiatives, to our newly launched Library Search, to the opening and fostering of the Digital Scholarship Center, to our Knight Foundation Award to explore preserving open civic data, the Libraries are poised for a rich, innovative future. Read more about these and other exciting initiatives and projects in the Libraries' Major News Round Up on pp. 18–21.</p>\r\n<h4>The 21st century library: a physical manifestation</h4>\r\n<p>Not only are we envisioning what the 21st century academic library can be–we are in the process of building one. Set to open in 2019, this extraordinary new building is designed by world-renowned architecture firm Snøhetta, and will be a dynamic and innovative space dedicated to broadening learning, inspiring creativity, and building community.</p>\r\n<p>Several key strategic goals guide the new library's design, including more than doubling the seating capacity of the current main campus library and offering a variety of forward-thinking, technologically sophisticated spaces. The new library will also collocate academic services and employ a variety of strategies for storing, accessing, and preserving our robust special and general collections like never before. And, as a first for Temple's central library, the building will also boast prominent, dedicated programmatic space and outdoor areas for gathering and learning.</p>\r\n<p>We look forward to keeping you updated as Temple University Libraries' story continues evolving, as we build on our important mission and work, and as our enterprise finds its new home in this groundbreaking building.</p>\r\n<h3>Temple's New Central Library Vision Statement</h3>\r\n<p>A catalyst for learning and intellectual engagement, the Temple University Library cultivates and supports scholars and the scholarly enterprise, connecting people and ideas in a compelling resource- and service-driven environment.</p>\r\n<p>Calling its diverse communities together for inquiry and exploration, interaction and study, this evocative building inspires the discovery, creation, preservation, and sharing of knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>See more renderings, floor plans, and details on how you can support this historic project at library.temple.edu/newlibrary</p>\r\n<p>The Libraries' fiscal year 2017 strategic plan, outlined below, has guided our recent work. We look forward to continuing to evolve the work that we do, the collections we share, and the spaces we call home.</p>\r\n<h3>Strategic Action Plan, Fiscal Year 2017</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Develop targeted library services for new and growing communities</li>\r\n<li>Develop a more integrated, system-wide approach to programming in support of the Libraries' vision of serving as a center for culture and academic support</li>\r\n<li>Integrate Temple University Libraries into teaching and learning at Temple</li>\r\n<li>Increase efficiencies in providing library and technology services</li>\r\n<li>Explore new ways of providing support for faculty research</li>\r\n<li>Enhance accessibility and discoverability of Temple University Libraries' collections</li>\r\n<li>Enhance organizational effectiveness with new workflow efficiencies and staff training</li>\r\n<li>Continue development of a culture of assessment throughout organization</li>\r\n<li>Continue to improve the quality of Libraries' physical environments and services while planning for new library</li>\r\n<li>Explore new collaborations in programming, publishing, and scholarly communication</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>History of Temple University Libraries Timeline</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>1892 Temple's first library, comprised of books donated by faculty, students, and friends, established in a row house at 1933 Park Ave</li>\r\n<li>1894 Library moves to College Hall, now Barrack Hall</li>\r\n<li>1911 Medical School Library organized</li>\r\n<li>1914 Law School Library organized</li>\r\n<li>1926 Russell Conwell's personal library donated to the Libraries</li>\r\n<li>1936 Sullivan Memorial Library opens as Temple's first free-standing library; President Franklin D.

According to Rebecca, the nature of the project \"strongly motivated students to do substantive research and to use reputable library resources, because they knew their work would reach a broad, public audience.\"</p>\r\n<p>Throughout the semester, Rebecca provided crucial support for identifying and using relevant sources. Rebecca also sought the assistance of Instruction Librarian Caitlin Shanley, who is well versed in Wikipedia editing, to organize library workshops for the class on Wikipedia principles and technical dimensions of the editing process.</p>\r\n<p>This project allowed students to see Wikipedia from multiple angles: from the potential pitfalls such as the lack of citations and thin or weak entries, to the benefits of its strong community and potential to reach a wide audience. Ultimately, the project provided a fuller picture of what Wikipedia is and its uses for certain types of research.</p>\r\n<p>As the first faculty-librarian partners at Temple to work on a Wiki project, Rebecca and Patricia presented at Temple's Teaching with Technology Symposium, and encouraged other Temple faculty to embrace similar projects in order to build information literacy skills and foster real-world applicability.</p>\r\n<h3>Student/Donor Quotes</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Evan Thomas, Undergraduate Student: I discovered that the library has a makerspace and I'm an engineering major so I am obsessed with makerspaces...And I feel like it's very beneficial for students to be focused on hands-on learning, because that's the way I learn...for someone like me who's very tactile–let's build something, take it apart, mess up, and just have to throw everything away and start over–a makerspace is a perfect place for that.</li>\r\n<li>Hasan Zaidi, 2017 Livingstone Undergraduate Research Award winner: Subject librarians helped me \"navigate the veritable labyrinth of resources that this library offers.\"</li>\r\n<li>Michael Glass, Graduate Student: I'm a graduate student here at Temple, and I work on philosophy, in a very specialized field...The library's been very helpful in trying to get me the resources I need, especially Fred Rowland, subject librarian in Philosophy...The library has access to a large amount of literature, so essentially this field which otherwise would be prohibitively expensive becomes possible for people like me to pursue because of access to the library.</li>\r\n<li>Estelle R. Alexander, CLA '69, Library Board of Visitors member, and Gerson J. Alexander, CLA '65, Donors:We support Temple University Libraries through the Estelle R. &amp; Gerson J. Alexander Librarians' Opportunity Fund, as we believe an outstanding research library is at the heart of our university.<br>*This fund will provide financial support to meet the changing needs of the Temple University Libraries. Income from the Library Fund will be expended by the University Librarian to fund new program initiatives or to support areas with pressing needs within the Libraries.*</li>\r\n<li>GVGK Tang, 2016 Livingstone Undergraduate Research Award winner: \"The library feels like a second home to me.\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Major News Round Up</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Libraries reshaped, expanded, and renamed the former Library Prize for Undergraduate Research, which has been supporting and celebrating student work since 2004. Now called the Livingstone Undergraduate Research Awards, the awards honor long-time donor John H. Livingstone, SBM ‘49, and recognize scholarly and creative work across a more diverse spectrum of disciplines.</li>\r\n<li>Temple University broke ground on our extraordinary new library building on April 19, 2016. The groundbreaking ceremony marked an important milestone for this highly anticipated project, set for completion in 2019.</li>\r\n<li>The success of the Libraries' Textbook Affordability Project has continued to grow. Devised to address the rising cost of textbooks, the project allows for library staff to work directly with faculty in helping them create more affordable course materials for their students. Now in its seventh year, the program has saved students over an estimated $500,000 in textbook costs.</li>\r\n<li>Our Libraries helped lead in the creation of PA Digital–read the full story on p. 23.</li>\r\n<li>Temple University Libraries and Press received a generous Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant to host the first ever P2L (Press Reporting to Libraries) Summit–read the full story on p. 22.</li>\r\n<li>The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded the Libraries a $35,000 grant for our proposed project to preserve open, publicly available civic data, answering the call of how libraries can serve 21st century information needs.</li>\r\n<li>Fall 2015 marked the opening of Paley Library's Digital Scholarship Center (DSC), a brand new facility aimed at providing the tools and resources for students, faculty, and scholars to incorporate emerging technologies into their research projects. A year later, the DSC launched a faculty fellowship program with Adrienne Shaw, assistant professor in the Department of Media Studies and Production, and Colin Chamberlain, assistant professor of philosophy.</li>\r\n<li>In order to help faculty and students navigate the increasingly complex and rapidly changing scholarly communication landscape, the Libraries have developed a number of new publishing services. We offer workshops and one-on-one consultations on author agreements and book contracts, Creative Commons licensing, open access, digital publishing, and more.</li>\r\n<li>The Libraries have expanded opportunities for the next generation of library and digital information leaders through our first-ever library residency program, as well as Council of Library and Information Resources (CLIR) fellowships and full graduate assistantships in the Digital Scholarship Center.</li>\r\n<li>Images from the John W. Mosley photograph collection, housed in the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection, have been featured in a range of exhibitions across the city and country, including Philadelphia's Woodmere Art Museum, the Philadelphia International Airport, Arts Sanctuary, and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.</li>\r\n<li>The Ginsburg Health Sciences Library supported the opening of the new Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University by creating an exhibition of historical medical school yearbooks and lending materials for the open house, student expo, and school-wide showcase to honor the renaming.</li>\r\n<li>The Libraries launched an Artist-in-Residence program, which is now the largest ongoing, collaborative effort in the Beyond the Page public programming portfolio. Over the course of this program, we have welcomed performance/new media artist Angela Washko, game designer and Professor Lindsay Grace, and L.A.-based artists' collective Fallen Fruit to Temple to discuss and share their ongoing work and projects.</li>\r\n<li>In preparation to move our collections into the new library's Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), we have launched a massive barcoding project to re-barcode all the books in Paley Library's robust general collections without barcodes on their outside back covers.</li>\r\n<li>We have implemented a new, integrated back end system, ALMA, to expedite circulation and acquisitions, store patron data, and house our library catalog. This more efficient platform will help us prepare to move our collections into the new library's ASRS.</li>\r\n<li>The Libraries prepared to launch the Library Search to replace Summon and the library catalog, to improve the online search experience, and make library resources more discoverable.</li>\r\n<li>Temple University Press and Libraries received a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) grant to make out-of-print labor studies titles openly available.</li>\r\n<li>Temple University Press is working on the launch of a new undergraduate open access research journal, Maneto. This unique project brings together undergraduates, graduate students, faculty, the Press, and the Libraries to collectively compile and edit the journal's inaugural issue.</li>\r\n<li>The Libraries implemented a \"Question of the Week\" board to engage students and visitors in Paley Library. Each week, the Libraries pose a new question for patrons to consider and respond to, such as favorite green spaces in Philadelphia, career aspirations, and how our students destress during hectic finals week.</li>\r\n<li>We acquired the full-image online archive of the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1860 to 2001. In time, we will house the full archives from 1829-2009.</li>\r\n<li>The Libraries have continued to bolster their full service of research consultation services. \"Ask a Librarian\" makes it easy to connect to librarians in a multitude of ways, consultations in the Think Tank allow for one-on-one sessions, and Crunch Time Clinics, a collaborative project with the University Writing Center, provide students with research and writing help during the stressful end of the semester crunch.</li>\r\n<li>To better serve students around final exam periods, we have expanded our Crunch Time Cafe offerings to include a greater variety of activities, games, snacks, and therapy dog sessions.</li>\r\n<li>In the fall of 2016, the Libraries partnered with Ithaka S+R to deploy a survey to Temple faculty. The results show that 80% of faculty strongly agree in the importance of the library as it helps undergraduates develop research, critical analysis, and information literacy tools. This figure is 10% higher than other research institutions responding to the natural survey.</li>\r\n<li>Ambler Campus Library was active in the development and preparation for Temple's exhibit at the 2017 Philadelphia Flower Show. Library staff helped provide information that inspired the exhibit title, \"Nieuwpolders: Regenerating the Dutch custom of land recovery,\" and also gathered materials for students to help them visualize and build their particular section of the exhibit, which won five major awards. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>The First P2L Summit: What We Learned</h3>\r\n<p>Academic libraries and presses have long shared a common mission: to collect, preserve, and disseminate information and scholarship. And, as publishing and digital scholarship evolves, Temple leverages this shared mission through aligning our Press with our Libraries.</p>\r\n<p>According to Mary Rose Muccie, executive director/scholarly communications officer of Temple University Press, collaborations between libraries and presses allow for a shared understanding of the challenges the other is facing in today's academic and publishing environments. And, we actively seek to engage in conversations with other institutions employing these partnerships.</p>\r\n<p>In May 2016, Temple University Libraries and Press hosted the first-ever P2L (Publishers Reporting to Libraries) Summit in Philadelphia. Generously funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and co-sponsored by the Association of Research Libraries, the Association of American University Presses, and the Coalition for Networked Information, the summit brought over 20 teams of university library and press directors together to discuss library-press partnerships.</p>\r\n<p>Muccie and Temple's Dean of Libraries Joe Lucia served on the summit program committee and co-authored a follow-up report, along with colleagues Elliot Shore of the Association of Research Libraries, Clifford Lynch of the Coalition for Networked Information, and Peter Berkery of the Association of American University Presses.</p>\r\n<p>This report, titled \"Across the Great Divide,\" addressed areas for understanding each other's skills and initiatives, as well as recommendations for future library-press collaborations, ranging from integrating press and library staff, to working jointly to create open educational resources, to developing a shared approach to digital scholarship. A future summit (P2L2) will build upon this collaborative work, inviting a broader audience and developing strategies for increasingly effective and meaningful partnerships.</p>\r\n<h3>Day-To-Day with DPLA and PA Digital</h3>\r\n<p>The Digital Public Library of America (DPLA) is a collaborative project that brings together records for digital objects, such as digitized historical photographs, manuscripts, video, and audio, from cultural institutions all over the country into one, free, easy-to-access portal. Temple University Libraries play a highly active role in managing Pennsylvania's first-ever central hub, PA Digital, whose partners also include the State Library of Pennsylvania, The Pennsylvania State University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Free Library of Philadelphia, among others, and which gathers digital items from all over the Commonwealth to channel into the larger DPLA collection.</p>\r\n<p>Library staff members Delphine Khanna, head of Digital Library Initiatives, along with Rachel Appel, digital projects and services librarian, Leanne Finnegan, database management librarian, and other staff members, are helping to shape PA Digital's portal and user experience. Together, they work on outreach, data quality, technical infrastructure, social media, and day-to-day project management.</p>\r\n<p>For example, Rachel Appel and Leanne Finnegan take the point position in helping institutions format their metadata, so that their items are findable and accessible. Leanne also volunteers for a national metadata quality working group, to help create guidelines for all hubs around the country to use, and Rachel participates in a national-level rights management group focused on making it easier for students, researchers, and other users to reuse digital objects in their own scholarly work and projects.</p>\r\n<p>According to Delphine Khanna, Dean Joe Lucia has \"identified this project as strategically important to the mission of the Libraries,\" and we will continue to invest resources in this initiative to increase accessibility of local and regional materials.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, PA Digital has links to over 214,000 digital objects from 38 contributing institutions around the Commonwealth. Visit dp.la and padigital.org to explore materials and learn more about this incredible project.</p>\r\n<h3>TUL by the Numbers July 2015 –June 2017</h3>\r\n<h4>Collections</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The percentage of electronic books increased from 33.09% in Fiscal Year 2016 to 35.84% in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n<li>The number of titles in all libraries increased from 3,558,573 in Fiscal Year 2016 to 3,770,771 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n<li>The number of electronic books increased from 1,177,422 in Fiscal Year 2016 to 1,351,582 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Digital Library Collections Geographic Reach</h4>\r\n<p>People in 202 countries and 11,898 cities viewed our digital collections.</p>\r\n<h4>Use of Collections</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The circulation of physical materials in all libraries increased from 129,253 in Fiscal Year 2016to 135,499 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n<li>Items Acquired through Interlibrary Loan increased from 18,428 in Fiscal Year 2016to 16,356 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n<li>Items Lent through Interlibrary Loan increased from 25,875 in Fiscal Year 2016 to 29,400 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>New Donors</h4>\r\n<p>New donors increased from 107 in Fiscal Year 2016 to 132 in Fiscal Year 2017.</p>\r\n<h4>Research Guide Usage</h4>\r\n<p>Number of online sessions increased from 408,724 in Fiscal Year 2016 to 418,441 in Fiscal Year 2017.</p>\r\n<h4>Expenditures</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The entire Library budget increased from $21,041,087 in Fiscal Year 2016 to $22,151,821 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n<li>The collections budget increased from $9,636,706 in Fiscal Year 2016 $10,382,141 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n<li>The staff budget increased from $9,947,318 in Fiscal Year 2016 $10,298,339 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n<li>The operating budget increased from $1,457,063 in Fiscal Year 2016 $1,471,341 in Fiscal Year 2017.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Temple University Press</h4>\r\n<p>The Temple University Press Published 87 titles in Fiscal Year 2016 and 2017.</p>\r\n<h4>3-D Printing</h4>\r\n<p>7 units using 3-D printing services at the Health Sciences Campus:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ginsburg Health Sciences Library</li>\r\n<li>School of Medicine</li>\r\n<li>Shriner's Pediatric Research</li>\r\n<li>Temple University Hospital</li>\r\n<li>Dental</li>\r\n<li>Engineering</li>\r\n<li>Facilities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Services to faculty and students</h4>\r\n<p>Summary of services to faculty and students in Fiscal Year 2016 and Fiscal Year 2017:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Over 2,500 Instruction Sessions</li>\r\n<li>Over 60,000 Students Served</li>\r\n<li>Over 3,300 In-Depth Research Consultations</li>\r\n<li>Over 32,000 Reference Questions Answered (includes consultations at Digital Services)</li>\r\n<li>Over 6,100 Reference Through LibChat</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Special Collections</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The Charles L.

On these pages, several library staff members share emerging and evolving trends and priorities they see in their areas of expertise, both at Temple University Libraries, and, more widely, in the field of academic libraries.</p>\r\n<p>\"A library is a product of collective imagination, a shared space for building together a sense of purpose and mission, always undergoing revision and change.\" –Dean Joe Lucia</p>\r\n<p>Steven Bell, Associate University Librarian:<br>\"I recognize a number of valuable priorities and trends at our Libraries, such as the deeper integration of the Libraries into teaching and learning at the university, an increased focus on designing a better user experience, building relationships with students and measuring student success, championing open access, and shifting focus from the consumption of library content to the creation of new content.\"</p>\r\n<p>Justin Hill, Department Head, Access Services:<br>\"I have noticed a rethinking of consortial relationships as a way to expand and build on existing programming. Consortial agreements have traditionally been centered around interlibrary loan activities but have recently been expanding to include programming, collection development, and on-site access to partner institution patrons. Efforts towards having large scale shared collections with partner libraries and using that to effectively manage space constraints are emerging as institutions are banding together under regional consortia to work together building collections.\"</p>\r\n<p>Delphine Khanna, Head of Digital Library Initiatives:<br>\"An important recent trend is to aggregate academic libraries' digitized rare and unique materials at the national (and eventually international) level with projects like the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), which aims at presenting all those collections in one single site for easier discoverability. In a similar vein, making sure that digitized collections are discoverable through generic search engines such as Google is key, since only a small portion of our potential users start their search on the library's website. In terms of content, there is an increased emphasis on making sure that digitized collections reflect a diversity of points of view and document the history of underrepresented groups. Another aspect of libraries' current work is to preserve \"born-digital\" materials, such as word documents, spreadsheets, digital maps, or datasets. A good example of that are partnerships between libraries, local governments, and nonprofits to preserve \"civic data\" that document a community's access to education, local transportation systems, voting patterns, health facilities, and other essential information for citizens and researchers.\"</p>\r\n<p>David Lacy, Director of Library Technology and Knowledge Management Services:<br>\"Libraries are in a state of perpetual change, continually rethinking organizational systems for collections, services, and staff. Currently under construction, Temple's new library will be furnished with an Automatic Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), a high-density storage system equipped with a robotic retrieval component that successfully repurposes large percentages of space typically reserved for shelves, converting it into collaborative and quiet study environments. This new approach to storage and delivery provides us with both a challenge in affording discovery of our books and resources, and with a wonderful opportunity to revise legacy mechanisms governing access and discovery by breaking with conventional order and exploring exciting new conventions in Virtual Browse, freeing our resources from the rigid organizational model enforced by shelves.\"</p>\r\n<p>Mary Rose Muccie, Executive Director/Scholarly Communications Officer, Temple University Press:<br>\"The number of university presses reporting to their university's library, as has been the case at Temple for nearly a decade, continues to grow. In particular, the area of scholarly communication has become an opportunity for presses and libraries to use their distinct skills and strengths and move toward a unified system of publication, dissemination, access, and preservation. Such a system better serves both the university and a press's wider audience of scholars, students, and the general public. Here at Temple, the Press and Libraries have partnered to create formal and informal programs and services in support of scholarly communication. Recent examples include the founding of and ongoing support for Maneto, an online journal of peer-reviewed undergraduate research created and edited by students; support for a digital supplement to a Temple faculty member's book, the print version of which was published by the Press; and educational presentations to the university community on issues in scholarly publishing. This list will grow as the Press and Libraries collaborate on more services that leverage their skills and expertise to support scholarship.\"</p>\r\n<p>Nancy Turner, Assessment and Organizational Performance Librarian:<br>\"There are multiple areas of innovation and strategic priorities driving Temple Libraries forward, including the Digital Scholarship Center, which continues to develop new workshops and programs, the Innovation Center at the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, and scholarly communications initiatives such as education about open access and open educational resources. Other strategic focus areas are learning support and student success; research data management services; instruction, outreach, and communications; and collection development strategy.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Staff Accomplishments</h2>\r\n<h3>Recent Presentations, Publications, Professional Service</h3>\r\n<p>Steven Bell, Associate University Librarian, was the keynote speaker at the Colorado Association of Libraries annual conference.</p>\r\n<p>Sara Cohen, Editor, Temple University Press, chaired the panel \"Acquisitions Editors and Faculty Editorial Boards: Toward a More Perfect Union\" at the Association of American University Presses (AAUP) 2017 Annual Meeting and was a panelist in the session \"Moving Up (and Around): Professional Development on the UP Circuit\" at the AAUP 2016 Annual Meeting.</p>\r\n<p>Erin Finnerty, Electronic Resources Librarian, was appointed to a two-year term on the ACRL Value of Academic Libraries Committee.

We are committed to providing research and learning services, to providing open access to our facilities and information resources, and to fostering innovation and experimentation. The Libraries serve Temple’s students, researchers, teachers, and neighbors on Main, Center City, and Health Sciences Center campuses in Philadelphia and on our Ambler and Harrisburg campuses.</p>\r\n<h4>Dean of University Libraries</h4>\r\n<p>Joseph Lucia</p>\r\n<h4>Library Outreach and Communications Administrator</h4>\r\n<p>Sara Curnow Wilson</p>\r\n<h4>Editor</h4>\r\n<p>Beckie Dashiell</p>\r\n<h4>Designer</h4>\r\n<p>Rachel Cox</p>\r\n<p>Visit our website at <a href=\"library.temple.edu\">library.temple.edu</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:libraries@temple.edu\">libraries@temple.edu</a></p>\r\n<p>You can find us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/templelibraries?lang=en\">@TempleLibraries</a>, Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tulibraries/?hl=en\">tulibraries</a>, Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/templelibraries/\">Temple University Libraries</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Contents</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Message from the Dean</li>\r\n<li>Our Mission</li>\r\n<li>Bringing the 21st Century Library to Life</li>\r\n<li>Charles Library Construction Update</li>\r\n<li>TUL by the Numbers</li>\r\n<li>Major News Round Up</li>\r\n<li>Exhibitions</li>\r\n<li>New Acquisitions</li>\r\n<li>New Temple University Press Publications</li>\r\n<li>Library Success Stories</li>\r\n<li>Public Programs</li>\r\n<li>Staff Accomplishments</li>\r\n<li>New Staff</li>\r\n<li>Support the Libraries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Message from the Dean</h3>\r\n<p>Dear friends,</p>\r\n<p>I am pleased to share with you Temple University Libraries &amp; University Press’s latest annual report, which highlights significant accomplishments and updates from the 2018 fiscal year (July 2017–June 2018).</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps one of the most exciting developments of the past year was the gift we received from trustee Steve Charles, KLN ‘80, to support and name our new library building. I celebrated my five year anniversary as Dean of Libraries over the summer: it was this project to build a 21st century academic library from scratch that helped draw me to Temple in the first place and has been a large part of my daily work ever since. Steve’s major commitment to the new library affirms the significance of what we are doing, and the impact Charles Library is poised to make on the Temple community and the city of Philadelphia.</p>\r\n<p>As Steve notes, “My business success came from opportunities at the intersections of multiple disciplines. When Joe explained the Temple University vision for the new library, within a few minutes I knew I wanted to be part of it.” We are ever closer to fulfilling our vision, and I cannot wait to welcome you to Charles Library next fall.</p>\r\n<p>We continue to advance our mission in other concrete, creative ways. You will read about our evolving organizational framework, which includes the creation of strategic steering teams, as well as new positions and reporting structures. These changes serve to further foster collaboration and communication among staff, as we work toward building a stronger, more agile organization.</p>\r\n<p>This report also highlights other major news items, important new acquisitions and publications, our rich public programs and exhibitions, and staff news and professional development activities. As you will see, 2018 has been a busy, fruitful year, and the current fiscal year, which is already underway, promises to be no different!</p>\r\n<p>I hope you enjoy reading about our recent activities. If you are interested in learning how you can support the Libraries, please see page 23 for more information. As always, we are so grateful for your interest in our work.</p>\r\n<p>With warm regards,</p>\r\n<p>Joe Lucia<br>Dean of University Libraries</p>\r\n<h3>Temple University Libraries &amp; University Press</h3>\r\n<h4>Mission:</h4>\r\n<p>Connecting people and ideas to enhance learning, research, clinical practice, and creativity.</p>\r\n<h4>Key Functions:</h4>\r\n<p>Temple University Libraries &amp; the University Press nourish and sustain the academic enterprise through:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Facilities, staff, collections, and services that support study, instruction, inquiry, and scholarship;</li>\r\n<li>Instructional and service engagement with the learning environment to aid students in the exploration and discovery of new ideas and the development of informed critical thinking;</li>\r\n<li>Provision of materials, tools, and expertise to amplify the productivity and extend the reach of students, scholars, researchers, and clinicians; and</li>\r\n<li>Dissemination of ideas and culture through publishing, events, outreach, and collaborative programming with academic and community partners.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Strategic Actions:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Designing and building a dramatically new library environment to serve as a catalyst for academic enterprise at Temple.</li>\r\n<li>Enriching the environment for learning and student success.</li>\r\n<li>Developing programs, services, and resources to enhance intellectual productivity, scholarly infrastructure, new modes of research, and clinical care services.</li>\r\n<li>Exploring new opportunities in publishing and scholarly communication.</li>\r\n<li>Seeking partners in innovation and experimentation to add value to library programs and to identify new avenues for economic support.</li>\r\n<li>Serving as a center of intellectual and cultural life.</li>\r\n<li>Serving as a repository of record for archival, rare, and unique materials and providing broad access to those collections.</li>\r\n<li>Building a world-class staff for leadership in the research library enterprise.</li>\r\n<li>Sharing the vision, making connections, broadening support.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Visit <a href=\"library.temple.edu/about\">library.temple.edu/about</a> for more information about the Libraries’ strategic guidance actions and principles.</p>\r\n<h3>Bringing the 21st Century Library to Life: The Libraries’ Evolving Organizational Structure</h3>\r\n<p>Over the past several years, we have reported extensively on building the 21st century library from the ground up, a vision that will be fully realized next year when we open Charles Library on Main Campus. While we eagerly anticipate this historic moment, we also recognize that our work is only as strong as the people who guide it: our talented staff members.</p>\r\n<p>Our library system is constantly evolving, and in recent years, we have made organizational changes that further reflect our mission to connect people and ideas by enabling us to operate more fluidly and engage staff in a greater number of areas across the organization. This past fiscal year, we have continued this work, bringing our vision into sharper focus.</p>\r\n<p>At our core, we envision a collaborative approach to the work that we do, both internally and externally. Inside our organization, we are exploring more flexible, lateral systems that include cross-functional teams and reporting structures over traditional hierarchical models, which can be rigid.</p>\r\n<p>For example, one of our new models involves bringing together staff members from across the organization to serve on strategic steering teams. These cross-functional working groups, which currently include Scholarly Communication, Outreach and Communications, Collections Strategy, and Research Data Services, address key strategic areas across the Libraries. The teams determine their own charges and objectives, and participation on the teams encourages increased knowledge-sharing, creativity, and shared ownership of work.</p>\r\n<p>The Libraries have also restructured teams of subject librarians to create the new Learning and Research Services unit. This new group is cohort-based and brings together librarians from connected disciplines to work collaboratively in supporting our academic mission, from instruction to collections to digital scholarship.</p>\r\n<p>We are further fostering our educational mission through creating new positions. The associate director for Organizational Research &amp; Strategy Alignment will coordinate and facilitate our focus on strategic priorities and new organizational framework. Reporting to that position is the new user experience librarian, who will focus on how our communities experience the Libraries both in our physical spaces and online. Finally, the coordinator of learning and student success will partner with other campus academic support units to advance the Libraries’ participation in student success programming.</p>\r\n<p>This evolutionary process is tied to next year’s opening of Charles Library, where staff will be situated in open offices. This open, flexible work environment will promote interdisciplinary connections, which mirror our mission to serve as an interdisciplinary campus center. As we actively build a community of practice around that vision, these organizational changes reflect our dedication to strengthening the Libraries’ academic mission and engagement with our diverse communities.</p>\r\n<h3>TUL By the Numbers</h3>\r\n<h4>Collections</h4>\r\n<p>Physical titles held: 2,095,639</p>\r\n<p>Electronic titles held: 1,979,748</p>\r\n<h4>Circulation</h4>\r\n<p>Lending to other libraries: 22,017</p>\r\n<p>Borrowing from other libraries: 16,782</p>\r\n<p>Circulation of physical collections: 126,557</p>\r\n<p>Article downloads: 2,719,625</p>\r\n<h4>Instruction</h4>\r\n<p>Number of sessions: 1,269</p>\r\n<p>Number of students served: 30,127</p>\r\n<h4>Reference</h4>\r\n<p>Total Reference Sessions: 13,767</p>\r\n<h4>Research Guides</h4>\r\n<p>Number of views: 381,568</p>\r\n<h4>Public Programs</h4>\r\n<p>Number of programs: 39</p>\r\n<p>Number of attendees: 2,070</p>\r\n<h4>Website</h4>\r\n<p>Number of sessions: 1,137,125</p>\r\n<h4>eBook Use</h4>\r\n<p>Total Book Section Downloads: 1,865,397</p>\r\n<h4>Top Ten Title Downloads</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Next Generation Excel+Website: Modeling in Excel for Analysts and MBAs</li>\r\n<li>Britannica Encyclopedia of World Religions</li>\r\n<li>Twentieth-Century Europe: A Brief History, 1900 to the Present</li>\r\n<li>Cool Infographics: Effective Communication with Data Visualization and Design</li>\r\n<li>Utopia Reader</li>\r\n<li>Building Brains: An Introduction to Neural Development</li>\r\n<li>Healthcare and Biomedical Technology in the 21st Century</li>\r\n<li>Handbook of Data Visualization</li>\r\n<li>Grove Music Online</li>\r\n<li>Oxford English Dictionary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Digital Scholarship Center</h4>\r\n<p>Number of consultations: 266 (an increase of 74% over last year)</p>\r\n<h4>Digital Library Collections Geographic Reach</h4>\r\n<p>People in 183 countries and 8,026 cities viewed our digital collections</p>\r\n<h4>Publishing</h4>\r\n<p>Temple University Press published 45 books and 4 journal issues</p>\r\n<h4>Donors</h4>\r\n<p>374 Total</p>\r\n<p>64 New</p>\r\n<h3>Major News Round Up</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Charles Library received two historic gifts, including a $10 million naming gift from entrepreneur and university trustee Steve Charles, KLN ’80, and a $1 million gift from the Albert M.

The re-barcoding project has been completed, which ensures that barcodes on books are in a consistent place for quick identification of items as they are retrieved from the Automated Storage &amp; Retrieval System (ASRS). We have also begun the sizing and marking of items based on which size ASRS bin will house them.</li>\r\n<li>In October 2017, the Special Collections Research Center celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Urban Archives. To honor this wonderful collection, we held a film screening featuring footage from the archives and an all-day symposium with panels comprised of former staff members and scholars, journalists, and filmmakers who have used the archives. These archives, which include approximately 800 collections, continue to grow and are a premier destination for those engaged in researching the social, economic, and physical development of the greater Philadelphia region from the mid-nineteenth century to the present.</li>\r\n<li>Joe Lucia celebrated his five year anniversary as Dean of Libraries in the summer of 2018.</li>\r\n<li>The Ginsburg Health Sciences Library’s new Innovation Space was unveiled, and has quickly become a popular resource for medical students, faculty, physicians, and researchers.

Construction is slated for completion next spring, and library staff and collections will move into the building over the summer.</p>\r\n<p>Charles Library’s personality is already shining, and we look forward to welcoming students, faculty, staff, and the community to our new building in the fall of 2019.</p>\r\n<h3>New Acquisitions</h3>\r\n<p>The Libraries are committed to preserving, growing, and making accessible the materials in our special collections, which include the Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) and the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection. The SCRC houses the Libraries’ rare books, manuscripts, archives, university records, and important regional collections such as the Urban Archives and the Philadelphia Jewish Archives. The Blockson Collection holds a variety of rare and contemporary publications, photographs, archives, and manuscripts documenting the histories of peoples of African descent.</p>\r\n<p>Recent acquisitions to the Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) and the Charles L.

Blockson Afro-American Collection Acquisitions</h4>\r\n<h5>The Nancy Leftenant-Colon Collection</h5>\r\n<p>Nancy C. Leftenant-Colon became the first African American member of the Regular Army Nurses Corps, and then served in the Air Force as an elite flight nurse on missions in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Her brother, Sam Leftenant, who was killed during World War II, was a pilot with the Tuskegee Airmen. Nancy Leftenant-Colon held the position of president of the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. from 1989 to 1991, making history once again as the only woman to serve as its president. This collection contains correspondence from family, friends, and supporters from 1948 to 1995, photographs from her service as a military nurse, her Vietnam War military flight log, many awards and certificates of appreciation, and papers pertaining to the Tuskegee Airmen.</p>\r\n<h5>The Rose S. Cook Photographs and Ephemera of Women in Beautician’s School</h5>\r\n<p>Rose S.

This collection contains photographs of the National Beauty Culturists League, Inc. 30th Annual Convention (Aug. 1949), classroom situations with students and instructors, photos of hair washing and hair styling demonstrations, and images of men and women at beauty and barber conventions.</p>\r\n<h5>Church of God and Saints of Christ Song Book</h5>\r\n<p>This songbook was published in 1919 by the Church of God Publishing House and helps the Blockson Collection broaden the scope of its holdings on African American religious practice and thought in Philadelphia. The Church of God and Saints of Christ was founded by William Saunders Crowdy (1847-1908) who moved to Philadelphia in 1900 and established his Church of God and Saints of Christ, which had a congregation of 1,500 and was one of the first Black Jewish religious groups.</p>\r\n<h5>The Relations of the Church to the Colored Race</h5>\r\n<p>This is a pamphlet of a speech the Reverend J. L. Tucker of Jackson, Mississippi gave on October 27, 1882 before the Church Congress held in Richmond, Virginia. In it, Tucker viciously attacked the intelligence and character of people of African descent. This speech was seen as a justification for the Jim Crow Laws enacted in the South. In 1883, Alexander Crummell, an African American Episcopalian clergyman and abolitionist, responded to Tucker’s racist attack on African Americans with his pamphlet, A Defense of the Negro Race in America from the Assaults and Charges of Rev. J. L. Tucker. Previously, the Blockson Collection possessed only Reverend Crummell’s rebuttal. This recent acquisition of the pamphlet of Reverend J. L. Tucker’s speech brings their debate over racism and the defense of slavery full circle and vividly illustrates an example of the intense debates occurring in the post bellum period between anti-slavery/anti-racist advocates and pro-slavery/pro-racist proponents.</p>\r\n<h5>The Hitchhiking Robot Learns About Philadelphia, Poems by Vernita Hall</h5>\r\n<p>This first edition, with cover art and design by Stephen Purnell, was published in 2017 in Philadelphia. Winner of the 2016 Moonstone Chapbook Contest, this chapbook chronicles a time-traveling stranger’s trek through Philadelphia, seeking a deeper understanding of Philadelphia’s life, culture, and history. Using the robot metaphor for how someone might navigate new territory in a mechanical way, Hall created poems in a variety of styles to explore such topics as the Mason Dixon Line, the Constitution, slavery, Henry “Box” Brown, abolition, Richard Allen, and the importance of the A.M.E. Church.</p>\r\n<h3>Select Temple University Press Publications</h3>\r\n<p>Temple University Press is a leading publisher of books in the social sciences and the humanities, as well as books about Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley region.

Essays, poems, fiction, photographs, and cartoons bristle with emotion from contributors responding to issues they consider most urgent: racism, sexism, poverty, and injustice... A heartfelt and thoughtful collection.”</p>\r\n<p>–Kirkus Reviews</p>\r\n<h4>The Cost of Being a Girl: Working Teens and the Origins of the Gender Wage Gap</h4>\r\n<p>Yasemin Besen-Cassino</p>\r\n<p>Yasemin Besen-Cassino explores the gender wage gap, which is one of the most persistent problems of labor markets and in women’s lives. She traces its origins to part-time teenage work, where she reveals differences in earning potential for boys and girls, and where inequality, which persists into adulthood, begins.</p>\r\n<p>“The American gender wage gap remains a yawning chasm, but people are looking for the cause in the wrong place, argues sociology professor Besen-Cassino in this fascinating study... This essential look at the origins of the persistent spread between a woman’s lifetime earning potential and a man’s casts a startling new light on an old problem.”</p>\r\n<p>–Publishers Weekly</p>\r\n<h4>Clowns to the Left of Me, Jokers to the Right: American Life in Columns</h4>\r\n<p>Michael A. Smerconish</p>\r\n<p>The opinions and evolution of Michael Smerconish, the provocative radio/TV host and political pundit, are shown in this collection of 100 of his most memorable columns, updated with facts and personal reactions that reflect his transition from a reliable Republican voter to a political Independent.</p>\r\n<p>“A good number of these columns have stood the test of time… They make for enjoyable reading and remind us that journalism properly practiced requires a good deal of nerve, honesty, and insight, along with openness to dialogue and the determination not to live in a bubble.”</p>\r\n<p>–The Daily Beast</p>\r\n<h4>Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years after the Kerner Report</h4>\r\n<p>Edited by Fred Harris and Alan Curtis</p>\r\n<p>In 1968, the Kerner Commission concluded that America was heading toward “two societies, one black, and one white—separate and unequal.” Healing Our Divided Society examines the work still necessary 50 years later to achieve the goals set forth in the Kerner Report.</p>\r\n<p>“This book is a must-read for anyone who is tired of the status quo and in need of both the inspiration to make a difference and proof that there’s still time to do it.”</p>\r\n<p>–John F. Kerry, sixty-eighth U.S. Secretary of State</p>\r\n<h3>Public Programs</h3>\r\n<p>Beyond the Page, the Libraries’ free public programming series, fosters conversations of social, scholarly, and educational value.

It has been a challenging year, and certainly not the one I envisioned as I, along with so many others, looked forward to our first year in a brand new library building. <br><br>As you may know, we opened the new Charles Library on Temple’s Main Campus last August. There was much excitement around this dynamic, inspiring new space, as well as a share of media interest and acclaim. But more importantly, after its grand debut, Charles Library became a beacon, drawing in students, faculty, staff, and visitors from around the city, region, and country through its doors and up through its four, light-filled floors. <br><br>But, like for all of us, the COVID-19 pandemic changed things. From March until August, our library buildings were closed and we shifted much of our work online. It was—to be honest—disheartening to see such a magnificent building as Charles standing empty.<br><br>Yet, we all know a library is about so much more than its physical presence. In the midst of upheaval, our library staff moved quickly to provide much-needed, remote services and resources. You will read more about that work in this report.<br><br>This report also highlights initiatives, projects, and accomplishments of the past fiscal year, from new special collections acquisitions and titles published by Temple University Press to major news items, staff achievements, and library statistics. <br><br>I’m proud of the work we’ve done during this time, and I also look toward the future with hope. If this experience has taught us anything, it’s that resilience is one of our greatest strengths. <br><br>Thank you for taking the time to read about our year at the Libraries. Your continuing interest in and support of our work is truly appreciated, and I wish you health and safety as we navigate this new territory together.<br><br>With warm regards, <br><br>Joe Lucia <br>Dean of University Libraries <br><br>Note: The 2020 fiscal year ran from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Many of the activities and images depicted in this report occurred prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<h2>Charles, Interrupted</h2>\r\n<h3>The First Year in Charles Library</h3>\r\n<p>In August 2019, we celebrated the opening of the new Charles Library on Temple’s Main Campus. This new building boldly envisions the future of academic libraries, and is a powerful testament to Temple’s commitment to teaching and learning.<br><br>As we prepared our 2019 Annual Report, we were already looking forward to the 2020 issue, when we could share stories from our first year in Charles Library with you. But that first year was interrupted in March 2020, when Temple moved classes fully online in an effort to keep the Temple community safe and to slow the spread of COVID-19. Charles Library, along with all our other library locations, was closed to the public until August of this year.<br><br>Despite these very challenging circumstances, we remained committed to serving our patrons and providing important resources and services even as our physical locations were closed. Library staff worked quickly to offer expanded access to online journals and databases, moved workshops and reference consultations online, contributed to a universitywide taskforce to produce PPE for Temple University Hospital, created tutorials and other online learning resources, and more. <br><br>As you read this report, Charles Library is open once more. We have enacted a variety of measures to ensure the safety of our visitors and staff at Charles and all our libraries, and we will continue to adapt and persevere in the coming months. In the meantime, we are grateful for this opportunity to share with you a few of our favorite memories from this first year in Charles and to celebrate some of the spaces, features, and people that make it such a special place.</p>\r\n<h3>A grand opening</h3>\r\n<p>We hosted a formal dedication ceremony for Charles Library on September 12, 2019. Representatives from the city and state were in attendance, along with university leaders, trustees, donors, architects, representatives from the student body, and the library’s namesake Steve Charles, <em>KLN ‘80</em>.<br><br>The following week, we held a massive all-campus celebration and welcomed students, faculty, staff, and members of the community into the new space. The day was filled with musical performances, 3D printing and VR demonstrations in the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio, a poetry reading by alumna Yolanda Wisher, and informal presentations about our services and other library locations.</p>\r\n<h3>Singular design</h3>\r\n<p>The first thing many of us notice about Charles Library is its stunning architecture. Designed by world-renowned architectural firm Snøhetta in collaboration with Stantec, a local leader in design and construction, stand-out features include the building’s unique geometry, its clever integration of spaces, and the amazing amount of daylight it brings inside. <br><br>Inside the building, visitors are struck by the intriguing combination of wood and concrete. A unique domed atrium opens up views throughout the building and acts as a wayfinding device. An oculus draws you up to the light-filled fourth floor, where open stacks are flanked by study rooms and quiet reading areas, while a glazed window at the third floor, cut into the warm wooden dome, provides a point of introspection, looking out over the sun-drenched lobby and to the campus beyond.</p>\r\n<h3>Notable awards</h3>\r\n<p>In its first year, Charles Library received numerous accolades, including the American Library Association (ALA)/International Interior Design Association (IIDA) 2020 Library Interior Design Award—Best in Competition, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) Education Facility Design Award, and Interior Design magazine’s Best of the Year Award. Charles Library was also featured in American Libraries magazine’s design showcase issue, published in September 2020, and profiled in the Wall Street Journal, Architectural Digest, and the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>\r\n<h3>Meet me at the Charles</h3>\r\n<p>Situated in the heart of Main Campus, Charles Library (affectionately referred to as “the Charles”) is an inviting space where students, faculty, staff, and members of the community want to gather. Prior to the campus closures related to COVID-19, groups on and off campus reserved spaces for meetings, while the university used Charles Library as a site for many universitywide events, including Experience Temple Day and the faculty and staff holiday gathering.<br><br>Charles Library’s main service point is the One Stop Assistance desk. Located on the first floor, this bustling spot is now the main point of contact for library users on Main Campus. There, we help users find and check out materials, connect with a subject librarian, or point people in the right direction.<br><br>During the fall and first part of the spring semester, you’d most often find the building busy with activity, from ongoing art installations to pop up concerts in the atrium to guided tours throughout the building. Not to mention all the open study areas and reservable study rooms where students and faculty were working independently or in groups.<br><br>The building’s outdoor spaces proved to be popular spots for collaborations, from our work with the Free Library of Philadelphia to sign visitors up for library cards outside the 13th Street entrance to a Mercury in transit viewing hosted by the College of Science and Technology on the fourth floor terrace. </p>\r\n<h3>Innovative technology</h3>\r\n<p>One of Charles Library’s most unique features is its Automated Storage and Retrieval System, which we call the BookBot. The BookBot houses the majority of our general collection and a portion of SCRC archives in high density storage bins. This allows more room for people, flexible spaces, services, and other resources throughout the building. <br><br>To retrieve books, patrons can search on our website and “order” books that are located in the BookBot. A robotic arm retrieves and delivers their orders to a library staff member. We still have a browsing collection of approximately 180,000 books located on the fourth floor.<br><br>At Charles Library, flexible space means mobile technology. Temple students, faculty, and staff can check out laptops and portable battery chargers from kiosks located on each floor and then return them to any kiosk in the library or across campus.<br><br>Another innovative space is on the third floor of Charles: the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio. Formerly the Digital Scholarship Center in Paley Library, the Duckworth Scholars Studio is a hub for cutting-edge creativity and collaboration, housing a variety of VR equipment, 3D printers, a Makerspace, high-end computing, and more. Duckworth Scholars Studio staff also host a variety of workshops and events, including a tabletop gaming series. </p>\r\n<h3>Under one (green) roof</h3>\r\n<p>For the first time ever, the Temple University Press office is now located in our Main Campus library. Known for publishing award-winning titles in the social sciences and the humanities, as well as regional titles, the Press is also involved in a variety of open access initiatives. Its new central location at Charles offers more opportunities for connection and collaboration and signals the Libraries’ and Press’ shared commitment to advancing scholarship.<br><br>Charles Library is also the new home of the Student Success Center (SSC), the university’s comprehensive, “one-stop-shop” academic support center serving graduate and undergraduate students. The center offers a wide range of services, including academic coaching, STEM and writing tutoring, as well as help for students who are developing a knowledge of English or other languages. The new SSC location makes it easier for students to access multiple services in one spot. <br><br>Another important space in Charles Library is the Special Collections Research Center (SCRC). The SCRC is the principal repository for and steward of the Libraries’ rare books, manuscripts, archives, and University records, and its upgraded facilities in Charles Library include the Albert M. Greenfield Special Collections Research Center Reading Room, a dedicated instruction room, a conservation lab, a rare book vault, and compact shelving.</p>\r\n<h3>Guided by sustainability</h3>\r\n<p>Sustainability is truly at the heart of Charles Library. Perhaps most noticeable is the massive green roof, which covers approximately 70% of the building’s roof surface and is one of the largest in Pennsylvania. Visible from many vantage points on the fourth floor, this meadow-like landscape is filled with ornamental grasses, perennials, groundcovers, bulbs, and sedums that are all native or naturalized to the region and provide a rich urban habitat for pollinators. The green roof also collects and stores most precipitation, which along with underground basins, mitigates the impact on the City’s stormwater system. <br><br>Charles was also designed to use less heating and cooling energy, and large glass windows reduce the need for artificial lighting during daylight hours. All the wood inside the building has been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, while all the toilets and sinks in Charles meet low water usage requirements.</p>\r\n<h3>A story behind every name</h3>\r\n<p>We’ve received numerous gifts to the Library Endowment to support Charles Library now and well into the future. Some of these gifts from our generous donors were made to name important spaces for study, research, and student engagement in the new building. <br><br>Here are the stories behind just a few of the named spaces that truly speak to the heart and mission of Charles Library:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Charles Library was named for entrepreneur and university trustee Steve Charles, KLN ’80, in recognition of his historic gift to the Libraries.</li>\r\n<li>The Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio was named in memory of Temple University trustee and Library Board of Visitors member Loretta C. Duckworth, CLA ‘62, ‘65, TYL ‘92, by her husband, the late W. Joseph Duckworth.</li>\r\n<li>The Albert M. Greenfield Foundation made a gift to name the Albert M. Greenfield Special Collections Research Center Reading Room. Mr. Greenfield was a philanthropist, political activist, and board member of many civic and philanthropic organizations, and our SCRC holds records documenting his many contributions to Philadelphia. The Greenfield Foundation also donated a portrait of Albert Greenfield that is on display in the reading room.</li>\r\n<li>The Frederic S. Schroeder and Family Green Roof was named by Library Board of Visitors Chair Sandra Lea Cadwalader, Law ‘74. Ms. Cadwalader also named the Lea Aspinwall Cadwalader Dean’s Office in honor of her mother.</li>\r\n<li>Russell Ring, whose family has deep ties to Temple and its history, named the Carlyle Conwell Ring, Jr. Staff Meeting Room in honor of his father. This space is part of the SCRC, which houses rich archives associated with Mr. Ring’s family and the university’s history.</li>\r\n<li>Harriette Hirsch has long supported the Libraries’ children’s literature collection and in Charles Library, the Dr. Paul and Mrs. Harriette Newman Hirsch, EDU ’55, ’61 Instruction Room is next to our collection of children’s literature on the fourth floor.</li>\r\n<li>The Vogel-Denebeim Family Special Collections Research Center Conservation Lab was named by Temple alumnus and Library Board of Visitors member Mark Vogel, CST ‘76, in honor of his family.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can read more about how to support Charles Library as well as other facets of our library enterprise on page 27.<br><br></p>\r\n<h2>Charles, Interrupted</h2>\r\n<h3>The Libraries Respond to COVID-19</h3>\r\n<p>During the spring and summer 2020 sessions, we provided critical services and resources amid our university’s quick transition to online teaching and learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>While some of these responses were specific to the building closures, we are carrying others into the fall semester as Temple offers mostly online courses. We supported (and continue to support) students and faculty by:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Working to provide expanded access to ebook and journal collections that had not previously been accessible to our users.</li>\r\n<li>Applying for and receiving HathiTrust’s Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS), which offered expanded access to digitized versions of items in our print collections. As part of this service, Temple students, faculty, and staff had online reading access to about 40% of our print collection while our buildings were closed.</li>\r\n<li>Working directly with patrons to help them find digital copies of books and articles, where available.</li>\r\n<li>Moving information literacy instruction and research consultations with subject librarians online.</li>\r\n<li>Creating new research guides, tutorials, and other online learning resources, and collaborating with Temple’s Center for the Advancement of Teaching to create a library support guide to aid in the transition to online teaching.</li>\r\n<li>Offering online workshops on a variety of topics, from mapping COVID-19 in Philadelphia and the region to managing archival research images to best practices in poster presentations.</li>\r\n<li>Creating a new webpage for users to explore our fully online library resources, including collections and support.</li>\r\n<li>Launching a creative writing contest around the theme of “Interruption,” to foster community while our locations were closed. The contest was open to Temple affiliates and the surrounding community and select works appear in our Short Édition short story dispenser in Charles Library.</li>\r\n<li>Extending due dates and eliminating late fines for library materials during building closures and into the fall semester, and expanding alumni access to digital materials.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>In the Makerspace: university initiative to make PPE</h3>\r\n<p>The Libraries’ Makerspace Manager David Ross was part of a group of Temple faculty, staff, and students who launched a universitywide initiative in March to produce personal protective equipment (PPE) for Temple University Hospital. Named the Temple University COVID-19 Assistance Team (TUCAT), this cross-disciplinary effort spanned from the College of Engineering and College of Science and Technology to Tyler School of Art and Architecture to Temple Libraries, Temple Health, and the Office of the Vice President for Research. <br><br>At the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio in Charles Library, Ross used 3D printers, laser cutters, and other equipment in our Makerspace to create and produce molds and face shields as part of this important project. Ross and his collaborators took a unique approach to PPE creation: rather than 3D printing the masks themselves, they printed molds out of which face shields could be cast. This process saved time and created equipment that could be reused. For a time, Ross was the only library staff member working out of Charles Library.<br><br></p>\r\n<h2>Temple University Libraries by the Numbers</h2>\r\n<h3>Collections</h3>\r\n<p>1,964,725 Digital titles held<br>2,321,470 Physical titles held</p>\r\n<h3>Circulation</h3>\r\n<p>45,922 Circulation of physical collections<br>7,807 Lending to other libraries<br>10,173 Borrowing from other libraries<br><br>Note: The Libraries were closed beginning March 19, 2020 through the end of the fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n<h3>Digital Collections</h3>\r\n<p>145,690 Number of visits</p>\r\n<h3>Research Guides</h3>\r\n<p>616,988 Number of sessions</p>\r\n<h3>Publishing</h3>\r\n<p>Temple University Press published <br>2 journal issues<br>44 books</p>\r\n<h3>Website</h3>\r\n<p>789,563 Number of visits<br>690,325 Library Search sessions</p>\r\n<h3>Eresource Use</h3>\r\n<p>2,582,363 Article requests<br>5,486,558 Database searches<br>524,229 Ebook title requests</p>\r\n<h3>Instruction</h3>\r\n<p>1,226 Number of sessions<br>25,373 Number of students served</p>\r\n<h3>Reference</h3>\r\n<p>3,746 In-person reference sessions<br>7,545 Virtual reference sessions<br>1,073 In-person consultations<br>728 Virtual consultations<br><br></p>\r\n<h2>Major News Round Up</h2>\r\n<p>While opening the new Charles Library and responding to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, we were involved in a number of other important activities and initiatives. We have highlighted some of these major news items on the following pages.<br><br>In the same month that we opened Charles Library, we also launched a brand new library website after several years of development and user testing. It serves to enhance discovery of library resources, and to promote the use of services and amenities both online and within our walls. <br><br>As we celebrated the 100th anniversary of women’s right to vote this year, staff from the SCRC and Metadata and Digitization Services continued to work on “In Her Own Right: A Century of Women’s Activism, 1820-1920,” a project of the Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries (PACSCL). “In Her Own Right” is a multi-phase, multi-grant-funded project to digitize and make accessible primary sources documenting women working for women’s rights in the century leading up to women getting the vote in Philadelphia and beyond.<br><br>Library staff worked with the College of Public Health to help publish the first issue of their open access online journal, CommonHealth.

The graphic novel, which has been supported by The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage, is a project of the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection. The exhibit provides a glimpse of the beautiful artwork featured in the graphic novel scheduled for release in 2021 and is on display in Charles Library through November 2020, after which it will be on display at the Blockson Collection.<br><br>We celebrated the winners of the 16th annual Livingstone Undergraduate Research Awards. While we were unable to hold this year’s ceremony due to the pandemic, we created a special website (sites.temple.edu/livingstone) to showcase the incredible work of these talented undergraduates and recreated the experience of the live event by linking to the winner’s work, getting faculty statements about the winners, and sharing the winners’ reflections on their projects. <br><br>The Temple University Beasley School of Law Library hosted its first ever open house in September 2019. The event allowed students and faculty to mingle with librarians, vendors, and each other.<br><br>Librarians in the Learning and Research Services department launched a podcast and video series exploring behind the scenes work at the Libraries, available on our Human Sciences blog at sites.temple.edu/humansciences. <br><br>The Libraries continued to champion and support open access through the Open Access Publishing Fund, North Broad Press, and the Textbook Affordability Project. The first North Broad Press open textbook, Structural Analysis by Felix Udoeyo, was published this year.<br><br>At the end of the spring semester, we teamed up with the Philly Goat Project to livestream goats from their farm on the Libraries’ Instagram account. This goat project, which drew more than 80 viewers, was a creative, safe alternative to the therapy dogs we typically bring in to help students destress during exams.<br><br>The Ginsburg Health Sciences Library unveiled its newest resource for students, faculty, and researchers: the Presentation Practice Studio. The new studio is tailor-made for the Temple community at the Health Sciences Center to practice public speaking, prepare for academic or professional presentations, and experiment with prerecorded video to augment presentations.<br><br>In late May, the SCRC issued an open call for quarantine mail art as a way to document experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. <br><br>The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection launched the Dr. Ione D. Vargus Lecture Series, a programming series established by Dr. Ione Vargus. In January, the inaugural program featured Robert W.

Blockson Afro- American Collection. The SCRC houses the Libraries’ rare books, manuscripts, archives, university records, and important regional collections such as the Urban Archives and the Philadelphia Jewish Archives. The Blockson Collection holds a variety of rare and contemporary publications, photographs, archives, and manuscripts documenting African and African American life and history. Recent acquisitions help build these valuable collections for students, scholars, and members of the broader community engaged in research. </p>\r\n<h3>Select Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) Acquisitions</h3>\r\n<p>The SCRC added over 335 feet of material to its holdings during the year, including the following new collections:<br><br>Charles Austermuhl donated his collection of Walter de la Mare (1873-1956) first editions, association copies, dedication copies, and letters, gathered over 30 years of dedicated collecting. Poet and author de la Mare’s work has long been a collecting interest in Temple’s special collections, starting with first editions before World War I and a significant purchase of letters by Library Director Walter Hausdorfer in 1959.<br><br>Jonathan Jager, TYL ’68, served with the 7th PsyOp (Psychological Operations) Battalion in Da Nang, Vietnam in 1969-70. His collection of over 100 of original drawings and printed pieces document that work and includes captions he wrote for an exhibition with additional context about the images.<br><br>Among the small theatre company records we have received recently are those of Flashpoint Theatre Company (2004-2018), a Philadelphia company that focused on performing contemporary works with a social focus. They are perhaps best known for their annual productions of David Sedaris’s SantaLand Diaries. The records include administrative files, posters, ephemera, clippings and reviews, and production photographs.<br><br>At the end of spring semester and during summer session, Professor Mabel Rosenheck’s Intellectual Heritage classes created digital COVID scrapbooks reflecting their experiences during the pandemic. <br><br>An SCRC priority is to continue to gather archives created by Philadelphia’s many neighborhood associations. A recent addition is the records of Cedar Park Neighbors (1963-2013), including board minutes and bylaws; activity binders; grant, project, and subject files; newsletters; and website. CPN is just west of University City.<br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Select Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection Acquisitions</h3>\r\n<p>The Blockson Collection recently acquired the resolution by the Philadelphia City Council on the murder of Emmett Till and the coverage in Life Magazine. This document, signed by City Council President James H.J. Tate with ink stamp of Councilman Raymond Pace Alexander, states that the murder of Emmett Till caused “great shame and loss” and his trial was a “tragic miscarriage of justice.” The resolution congratulates Life Magazine for its October 10, 1955 issue, “In Memoriam Emmett Till.” Till was a 14-year-old Chicagoan visiting relatives in Mississippi, who was tortured, shot, and killed in August 1955, for allegedly whistling at a white woman. At the trial, his murderers were acquitted.<br><br>Reverend Nelson Carter (1808-1856) was an African Methodist Episcopal Church minister in Western Pennsylvania. This collection includes the family Bible, printed in 1847 by the American Bible Society, with a five-page handwritten insert of family births and deaths from 1808 through 1950. The family papers consist of photographs, handwritten and typed letters, a memorandum book, a ten-page family history with a two-page narrative of Jane Carter (1808-1900) under slavery, and two typed letters by her lawyer son William A. Butler of Washington, PA, one of which was to the Gazette Times stating that neither he nor his family had ever been “insulted because of color” in the town.<br><br>Our faculty and students, who often research historical representations of race in America, find cultural products such as advertisements excellent teaching tools. A new addition to the collection is: You Got to Have Soul! An advertisement for sheen conditioner, shampoo, afro combs, and other products by LaCrosby Beauty Supply Co., Inc. Jose LaCrosby (1927-2016) was a nationally renowned African American hairdresser in San Francisco who owned the company. The advertisement was published around 1970 at the height of the Black Power and Black Cultural Movements, when activists and intellectuals promoted the wearing of natural African hairstyles and the use of African influenced fashion.<br><br>Black Control of the Black Community: Vote Socialist Workers in 1970 is a document in keeping with the 1966 ten-point Black Panther Party platform, which demanded equal justice in all areas of life for African Americans and Black control of the Black community.<br><br>Another new acquisition is the Elaine Brown, Democrat City Council District #3 poster, which reads “Elect Elaine: Vote April 15th.” This poster was for Elaine Brown’s unsuccessful campaign to be on the Oakland City Council in 1973. Born in Philadelphia, Brown grew up on York Street in North Philadelphia. She graduated in 1961 from Philadelphia High School for Girls. After briefly attending Temple University, she moved to Los Angeles in 1965 and joined the Black Panther Party. A singer, Brown recorded two albums containing Black Panther themed songs and became a member of the Black Panther Party’s Central Committee. From 1973 through 1977, Elaine Brown was the chair of the Black Panther Party.<br><br></p>\r\n<h2>New Temple University Press Publications</h2>\r\n<p>Temple University Press is a leading publisher of books in the social sciences and the humanities, as well as books about Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley region. These selected titles represent a range of new Press offerings from the past fiscal year. <br><br>Shakespeare and Trump<br>Jeffrey R. Wilson<br>In this new book, Jeffrey Wilson asks the question: should we draw an analogy between Shakespeare’s tyrants—Richard III, Julius Caesar, Macbeth, and King Lear—and Donald Trump? From reading Trump’s first 100 days in office against Netflix’s House of Cards to exploring a summer 2017 Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar wherein an assassination of a Trump-ian leader caused corporations to withdraw sponsorship, Wilson uncovers a surprising—and bizarre—relationship between the provincial English playwright and the billionaire President of the United States, ostensibly a medieval king living in a modern world. The comparison reveals a politics that blends villainy and comedy en route to tragedy.<br><br>“Wilson’s take on Richard Gloucester, Frank Underwood, and Trump is as deft as it is insightful...it shows in compelling detail how Richard and Underwood win complicity from their on- and off-stage audiences, and then demonstrates how Trump and his various courtier-goons have used many of the same techniques.... Shakespeare and Trump is unmistakably personal; it is engaging, energetic, open and easy to read.”<br>—The Times Literary Supplement <br><br>Invisible People: Stories of Lives at the Margins<br>Alex Tizon, Edited by Sam Howe Verhovek, Foreword by Jose Antonio Vargas<br>Every human being has an epic story, according to the late Pulitzer Prize–winning writer Alex Tizon, who spent his career telling the epic stories of marginalized people. Edited by Tizon’s friend and former colleague Sam Howe Verhovek, Invisible People collects the best of Tizon’s rich, empathetic accounts—including the Atlantic magazine cover story about the woman who raised him and his siblings under conditions that amounted to indentured servitude, “My Family’s Slave.” Tizon’s pieces brim with enlightening details about people who existed outside the mainstream’s field of vision.<br><br>“Tizon’s talent was in seeking out those with stories to tell outside of the mainstream: those who don’t quite fit in, whether because of their race, religion, ethnicity, or lifestyle. Easy answers don’t exist in Invisible People; each piece leaves the audience a little bit unsettled, wanting more. The collection may focus on those who are invisible, but Tizon’s writing was anything but.”<br>— Foreword Reviews<br><br>The Great Migration and the Democratic Party: Black Voters and the Realignment of American Politics in the 20th Century<br>Keneshia N. Grant<br>Where Black people live has long been an important determinant of their ability to participate in political processes. In addition to its social and economic impacts, the Great Migration significantly changed the way Democratic Party elites interacted with Black communities in the northern cities of Detroit, New York, and Chicago. Many white Democratic politicians came to believe the growing pool of Black voters could help them reach their electoral goals and these Black migrants built coalitions with local parties as they became politically active. By focusing on the Great Migration’s significant political consequences for U.S. cities, Grant goes where few scholars have gone before and lays the groundwork for ways of thinking about the contemporary impact of Black migration on American politics.<br><br>Monument Lab: Creative Speculations for Philadelphia<br>Edited by Paul M. Farber and Ken Lum<br>What is an appropriate monument for the current city of Philadelphia? That was the question posed by the curators, artists, scholars, and students who comprise the Philadelphia-based public art and history studio Monument Lab. And in 2017, along with Mural Arts Philadelphia, they produced and organized a groundbreaking, city-wide exhibition of temporary, site-specific works that engaged directly with the community. The installations, by a cohort of diverse artists considering issues of identity, appeared in iconic public squares and neighborhood parks with research and learning labs and prototype monuments. Monument Lab is both a catalog of the exhibition and a critical reflection on the proceedings, including contributions from interlocutors and collaborators. A stunning achievement, the exhibition prompted civic dialogue about public art and history around what it means to be a Philadelphian, a conversation that remains especially relevant as we consider how to reflect on the meaning of social justice.<br><br>Good Reasons to Run: Women and Political Candidacy<br>Edited by Shauna L. Shames, Rachel I. Bernhard, Mirya R. Holman, and Dawn Langan Teele<br>After the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, a large cohort of women emerged to run for office. Their efforts changed the landscape of candidates and representation. However, women are still far less likely than men to seek elective office, and face biases and obstacles in campaigns. The editors and contributors to Good Reasons to Run, a mix of scholars and practitioners who are leaders in the field of women and politics, examine the reasons why women run—and do not run—for political office. They focus on the opportunities, policies, and structures that promote women’s candidacies and ask not just who wants to run, but how to activate and encourage such ambition among a larger, diverse population of potential female candidates.<br><br>Visit <a href=\"tupress.temple.edu\">tupress.temple.edu</a> to learn more about the Press and to browse titles.<br><br></p>\r\n<h2>Public Programs</h2>\r\n<p>Beyond the Page, the Libraries’ free public programming series, fosters conversations of social, scholarly, and educational value as we invite artists, writers, scholars, and experts in a variety of fields to address topics of importance to Temple and the surrounding community.<br><br>This past academic year, the opening of the new Charles Library inspired us to explore the history and future of the book. We examined how books have evolved, how libraries adapt to meet user needs, and what Charles Library makes possible for our staff and patrons.<br><br>In addition to this curated series, we offered a variety of panels, collaborations, workshops, performances, and lectures, such as our award-winning Beyond the Notes concerts and long-running Chat in the Stacks programs. <br><br>And while we had to postpone some of our spring programs amid the closing of the library buildings, we were able to swiftly move a number of events and workshops online in order to continue to offer academic and cultural programs to our users. <br><br>Highlights from this year’s programs include: <br><br>Faculty and graduate students delve into the history and future of the book<br>We invited several faculty members, graduate students, and alumni to Charles Library to discuss their own research on that most iconic of library resources: the book. We held two events—one in the fall and one in the spring—and heard about work being done at the Tyler School of Art and Architecture, the Lewis Katz School of Medicine, and in the English department via a series of fascinating lightning talks. SCRC staff also prepared pop-up exhibits featuring archival materials as part of these talks. <br><br>Building the 21st century library: reflections on a project completed<br>In 2016, we launched a multi-year program series in collaboration with the Tyler School of Art and Architecture to explore the process of building a 21st century library as we embarked on our own project here at Temple. And this past spring, we held the culminating event in this series in our new Charles Library event space with the architects, project managers, and other professionals involved in the design and construction of the new building reflecting on their work and the finished project. <br><br>Hands-on workshops exploring data art<br>As part of Love Data Week in February, the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library invited artists Mina Zarfsaz and Angela McQuillan to lead a hands-on workshop exploring the idea that we need to interpret data for it to have a cultural value. Participants learned how data can be represented using sound and created their own art. Later that week Mina Zarfsaz also gave a talk and led a demo with her students at Charles Library on Main Campus.<br><br>A virtual Juneteenth celebration: in memory of Bootsie Barnes<br>The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection moved its annual Juneteenth program to Zoom this year for a virtual celebration of Black Music Month featuring the late Philadelphia jazz legend Robert “Bootsie” Barnes. The program featured Bootsie’s wife Sandra Turner Barnes, a performance by Bootsie’s grandson Reginald Lewis, and video of Bootsie’s performance at the Blockson Collection in 2014.<br><br>Pop-up concert in Charles<br>Charles Library has opened up new possibilities in programming for us, one of which is the ability to hold events in different areas throughout the building.

The patron later wrote, “for me, as [a] recent alum, the library resources have been valuable as a resource for entrepreneurship and career development.” Their follow-up feedback was also glowing, “You can’t improve on perfection!”<br><br>Lisa Fitch, senior associate director of PhD programs in the Office of Research and Doctoral Programs at the Fox School of Business, reached out to Curator of the Blockson Collection, Diane Turner, after an event to say: <br>“A tremendous thank you for allowing FOX to use the Feinstone Lounge and the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection for the Fox School Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Networking Event yesterday. The space was beautiful and suitable for the celebration of Black History Month and Temple University’s history of supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion. The exhibitions were well received by the guests and I hope that our faculty, staff, and students who attended the event will encourage others to visit the Collection. Also, special thanks to Aslaku Berhanu and your staff for their assistance in providing materials and information to us during the event.”<br><br>A student needed help getting started on finding published research in the Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences. The librarian staffing Temple Libraries’ chat service, Sarah Jones, directed them to the libraries’ Communication Sciences and Disorders guide, which was exactly what they needed to jumpstart their research. The student wrote that the chat experience “couldn’t have been better. [The librarian] quickly and efficiently directed me to my intended resource with no delay. Much appreciated.”<br><br>While campus was closed, School of Social Work students working on literature reviews met with the social work librarian, Olivia Given Castello, via Zoom for advice on their research strategies for finding intervention studies on trauma treatment effectiveness, and tips on finding the full text of articles. One student wrote, “I only wish I had gone to her BEFORE I started my paper.”<br><br>To increase support of the Temple Health Sciences Center patrons, Health Sciences Libraries staff moved workshops online at the start of the pandemic. They also scheduled new workshops in increasing numbers. From March 17th to June 30th, they held 20 workshops with 320 registrants from across Temple, the region, and the world, including Temple alumni in California and students from Portugal.<br><br>Attendees enjoyed the opportunity to attend remotely and found the sessions engaging and well produced. Comments included:<br>“Great online transition—really I had no idea it was the first online presentation of this workshop since it ran so smoothly!”<br>“Zoom was an effective method to present this information. It went very smoothly and the polls were effective. I think that this is a good method for presentation in the future and would allow for larger groups to sit in on the information.”<br><br>Doctoral students in the Music Therapy Department are expected to know systematic review skills as part of their preparation for their dissertations. After Stephanie Roth, biomedical and research services librarian, assisted a student in understanding these skills, Dr. Wendy Magee sent this email to Stephanie: “As for the type of help you have provided, it is exactly health sciences help that the students need for these reviews. [...] So your specific skills for this class and level of work is really needed.”<br><br>The Law Library began a collaboration with Temple Law’s International Programs to provide resources to current and future students, as well as program alumni. The law librarians created a research guide geared towards international students’ needs and produced a series of videos on topics such as United States courts and government, taking the bar exam, and using legal databases. <br><br>The Innovation Space at Ginsburg Health Sciences Library continued to be a popular resource for teaching and learning. For example, Dr. Hillel Maresky (Radiology) taught residents cardiovascular anatomy with the Sharecare VR program in the Innovation Space, while Dr. John Duffy brought nursing students to the space to use the Empathy Training Software. And in November, the Innovation Space was a featured stop on tours Dr. John Daly, Lewis Katz School of Medicine (LKSOM) interim dean and dean emeritus, led for the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Mitchell Morgan, and Executive Vice President and Provost, JoAnne Epps. <br><br>Masterman High School student Giuliana Alleva won 3rd place in the National History Day Senior Individual Documentary category. She did some of her research for “‘Don’t Buy Where You Can’t Work’: Leon Sullivan’s Fight Against Job Discrimination” in the Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center.<br><br>A third year School of Podiatric Medicine student experimented with the Podiatry Library’s 3D printer to make 3D models of arteries to help first year students learn about and visualize nerves and blood vessels.<br><br>Natalie Tagge, head of the Podiatry Library, always tells attendees at the “Best Practices in Poster Presentation” workshop that they can email her after the workshop with a poster for her to review. A student emailed Natalie asking if she would review her first-ever poster presentation that she would be submitting in two weeks, and Natalie provided feedback based on the content of the workshop.<br><br></p>\r\n<h2>Staff News</h2>\r\n<h3>Staff Accomplishments</h3>\r\n<p>Recent Presentations, Publications, and Professional Service<br><br>Aslaku Berhanu, Charles L.

        "description": "<p>Temple University Libraries &amp; the University Press will foster learning, enhance intellectual life, amplify scholarly impact, and extend the reach of the imagination for their diverse local, national, and global communities through concerted action in these key areas: </p>\r\n<h2>1. Designing and building a dramatically new library environment to serve as a catalyst for academic enterprise at Temple. </h2>\r\n<p>At the heart of the Temple campus, this new central library will embody emerging modes of library mission while sustaining and transforming traditional library functions and commitments, with a quality and thoughtfulness of design that will be a model for other research universities nationally and internationally in the digital age. </p>\r\n<h2>2. Enriching the environment for learning and student success. </h2>\r\n<p>The libraries will be a rich ecosystem for learning, providing services, instruction, tools and materials in light of diverse and evolving student needs, interests and predilections, in dialog with faculty and administrators, with an emphasis on curricular integration of information literacy, personalization and personal contact. </p>\r\n<h2>3. Developing programs, services, and resources to enhance intellectual productivity, scholarly infrastructure, new modes of research, and clinical care services. </h2>\r\n<p>The libraries will support a diverse environment for the exploration of new modes of scholarship, engaging all fields of academic endeavor as a multi-disciplinary contact zone and intellectual workshop, connecting students, clinicians and scholars with collections, tools, librarians, and technical experts. </p>\r\n<h2>4. Exploring new opportunities in publishing and scholarly communication. </h2>\r\n<p>The libraries will engage in deep collaboration with Temple University Press, with Temple faculty, and with other organizations and academic institutions to identify and adopt new approaches for sharing scholarly products, for exploring sustainable economic models for university publishing, and for connecting local publishing initiatives with Temple’s faculty. </p>\r\n<h2>5. Seeking partners in innovation and experimentation to add value to library programs and to identify new avenues for economic support. </h2>\r\n<p>The libraries will connect with a broad set of partners and collaborators at Temple and beyond to amplify their capacity for innovation, invention, and the exploration of emerging opportunities, both in technological domains (gaming, data visualization, data management, digital scholarship, health informatics etc.) and in areas where new revenue opportunities may be involved (publishing, foundation support, corporate partnerships, donor support, joint training and certification programs, etc.). </p>\r\n<h2>6. Serving as a center of intellectual and cultural life. </h2>\r\n<p>The libraries will engage with schools and colleges, academic departments, interest groups, individuals, and community organizations to stimulate conversation, support the exchange of ideas, to provide a lively agenda of events, serving as a center of intellectual, cultural and civic life for Temple University and its neighboring urban community. </p>\r\n<h2>7. Serving as a repository of record for archival, rare, and unique materials and providing broad access to those collections. </h2>\r\n<p>Building on deep archives and special collections that reflect not only Temple’s institutional history, mission, and geographical centrality to the Philadelphia urban community, but also its commitment to intellectual engagement in the arts, book arts, and alternative movements, and recognizing the reputation of the Blockson Collection as an important resource for African American history and culture, the libraries will continue to expand their holdings, providing access to an ever growing set of their holdings in digital form. </p>\r\n<h2>8. Building a world-class staff for leadership in the research library enterprise. </h2>\r\n<p>Recognizing that leadership, innovation, creativity, and dynamism in any enterprise are the product of personal commitment and staff empowerment, the libraries will create a flexible and forward-looking work environment that embraces transparent management practices, clear communication channels, individual accountability, fiscal responsibility, efficiency, a culture of experiment and continuous learning, opportunities for growth, and work-life balance, with the goal of becoming a model organization for contemporary research libraries. </p>\r\n<h2>9. Sharing the vision, making connections, broadening support. </h2>\r\n<p>As Temple University Libraries realize the ambition to be leaders in defining 21st century academic librarianship, they must share their story and build on successes and lessons learned, identifying further opportunities for growth and innovation, and opening up new avenues for support and partnership via private, corporate and foundation philanthropy and through cooperative enterprise with other organizations and institutions nationally and globally. </p>\r\n<p>(Revised &amp; Re-affirmed, September 2017) </p>",

        "description": "<h1>Temple University Libraries <br>Annual Report <br>Fiscal Year 2019</h1>\r\n<h2>About the Libraries</h2>\r\n<p>Temple University Libraries serve as trusted keepers of the intellectual and cultural record—including physical and digital collections, rare and unique books, archives, and the products of scholarly enterprise at Temple. <br><br>We are committed to providing research and learning services, to providing open access to our facilities and information resources, and to fostering innovation and experimentation. <br><br>The Libraries serve Temple’s students, researchers, teachers, and neighbors on Main, Center City, and Health Sciences Center campuses in Philadelphia and on our Ambler and Harrisburg campuses. <br><br></p>\r\n<h2>Contents</h2>\r\n<p>Message from the Dean <br>Library as Place: Exploring the Libraries of Temple University <br>Temple University Libraries by the Numbers<br>Major News Round Up <br>New Acquisitions <br>New Temple University Press Publications <br>New Digitization Projects <br>Public Programs <br>Exhibits <br>Staff News <br>Library Stories <br>Support the Libraries <br><br>Dean of University Libraries <br>Joseph Lucia <br><br>Library Outreach and Communications Administrator <br>Sara Curnow Wilson <br>Editor <br>Beckie Dashiell <br><br>Designer <br>Rachel Cox <br><br>Visit our website at <a href=\"library.temple.edu\">library.temple.edu</a><br><a href=\"mailto:libraries@temple.edu\">libraries@temple.edu</a><br>You can find us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/templelibraries?lang=en\">@TempleLibraries</a>, Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tulibraries/?hl=en\">tulibraries</a>, Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/templelibraries/\">Temple University Libraries</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Message from the Dean</h2>\r\n<p>Dear friends, <br><br>The 2019 fiscal year was a momentous one for Temple University Libraries. We celebrated the end of an era—the closing of Paley Library on Temple’s Main Campus in May. And we marked a new chapter for the university and our library enterprise, as we commenced the move into the spectacular new Charles Library. This building sets the stage for a new kind of academic library, and I am so proud that Temple is leading that charge. <br><br>As you read this report, Charles Library is open and thriving, and we look forward to sharing stories from our first year in this incredible new space in next year’s annual report. <br><br>Amid such big changes on Main Campus, we have continued to engage in our important work across all of Temple’s libraries. This year’s report shines a special light on our libraries as distinct and unique spaces serving a variety of communities in meaningful ways. <br><br>I am also proud to share with you other major news items, important acquisitions and publications, vital statistics, staff news, and stories from our patrons. This has been a remarkable year for Temple University Libraries, and I’m so excited for what the next year will bring. Thank you for being a part of our story and our future. <br><br>With warm regards, <br><br>Joe Lucia <br>Dean of University Libraries <br><br>Note: The 2019 fiscal year ran from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019. </p>\r\n<h2>Library as Place: Exploring the Libraries of Temple University</h2>\r\n<p>A library is many things: a collection of resources and materials, a center of culture, a house of knowledge and expertise, a physical place. In this year’s report, we honor the library as place and invite you to take a look at and learn about all of Temple University’s libraries. <br><br>While Paley Library served as our center of operations, that distinction has now passed on to Charles Library. Yet, the Libraries extend well beyond our Main Campus branch. On the following pages, we’ll highlight our other library locations in the Philadelphia area, which include the Health Sciences Libraries, the Ambler Campus Library, and the Beasley School of Law Library. <br><br>We also serve Temple University Harrisburg, and additional library locations include the Temple Rome Library and Japan Campus Library System. <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>A Fond Farewell to Paley Library</h3>\r\n<p>Since 1966, Samuel L. Paley Library served as Temple University’s Main Campus library. On May 9, 2019, we said goodbye to Paley Library as we welcomed students, alumni, faculty, staff, and members of the community into Paley one last time for a day of activities and celebration.More details about this event can be found in the summer 2019 issue of our newsletter, Speaking Volumes. <br><br>At the end of the day, we officially closed Paley Library to the public. The building will live on as “Samuel Paley Hall” as the new home for the College of Public Health and will continue to house the Center for Academic Advising and Professional Development for the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Science and Technology. <br><br>Charles Library officially opened to the public on August 25, 2019. It now serves as the intellectual and cultural heart of Temple’s Main Campus, and we cannot wait to share more with you as our first year in Charles unfolds. <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Moving to Charles</h3>\r\n<p>We have been preparing for the move to Charles Library for several years, including this year’s project to measure and apply colored stickers to books to signal where they would go in the Automated Storage and Retrieval System or in the open stacks. The physical collections move process began in earnest once we closed Paley Library in May. <br><br>Over the course of the summer, we moved over 1.5 million books, many of which were loaded into the Automated Storage and Retrieval System, also known as the BookBot. Around 180,000 books were designated for open stacks shelving on the library’s fourth floor. <br><br>Staff from the Special Collections Research Center loaded approximately 12,000 records center cartons into the BookBot. SCRC materials were also moved into the rare book vault, compact shelving, and the Albert M. Greenfeld SCRC Reading Room shelves. It took us over 17,000 hours to load our general collections into the BookBot. Library staff spent thousands more hours <br><br>triaging books that were originally rejected by the BookBot for a variety of reasons. The move was a massive undertaking, and we are so pleased to have completed it! <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>The Health Sciences Libraries</h3>\r\n<p>The Health Sciences Libraries of Temple University serve the Schools of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, Podiatry, and the College of Public Health. </p>\r\n<h4>Ginsburg Health Sciences Library</h4>\r\n<p>The Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, named for Simmy and Harry Ginsburg, opened in June 2009 in the Medical Education and Research Building on the Health Sciences Center campus in North Philadelphia. <br><br>The library oﬀers a variety of study spaces, workshops, and a range of services from expert health sciences librarians. Ginsburg Library is home to the Innovation Space, which opened in 2017 and features a selection of 3D printers, scanners, and virtual and augmented reality systems. <br><br>Ginsburg Library offers two special use rooms for Innovation Space. The School of Podiatric Medicine <br><br></p>\r\n<h4>Krausz Library of Podiatric Medicine</h4>\r\n<p>The Krausz Library of Podiatric Medicine, named after Dr. Charles E. Krausz in honor of his many contributions to the profession and school, was founded in 1963. It’s located in the Temple University School of Podiatric Medicine in downtown Philadelphia. <br><br>Temple is home to one of only nine podiatry schools in the United States. In addition, staﬀ at the Podiatry Library have recently added library instruction into the curriculum and begun to oﬀer drop-in workshops. <br><br>The Krausz Library oﬀers bone models for students to check out for study, as well as a 3D printer that functions as an extension of Ginsburg Library’s Innovation Space. The School of Podiatric Medicine is also home to an extensive shoe museum. <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Ambler Campus Library</h3>\r\n<p>The Ambler Campus Library supports students and faculty at Temple’s Ambler Campus, which was originally the site for the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women, founded in 1910. In the 1950s, the school merged with Temple University’s Ambler Junior College to create Ambler Campus as we know it today. <br><br>The Ambler Campus Library opened in 1959. Today, it oﬀers teaching and learning resources for those engaged in the study of landscape architecture, horticulture, business, education, and criminal justice, and supports many general education and ﬁrst year studies classes. <br><br>Each year, Ambler Library staﬀ oﬀer research assistance and support for the Landscape Architecture and Horticulture program in the Department of Architecture and Environmental Design’s yearly Philadelphia Flower Show exhibit.<br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Law Library</h3>\r\n<p>Founded in 1913, the Temple University Beasley School of Law Library has a long history as a research library and a service-oriented facility to the Law School. Located in the Klein Law Building on Temple Main Campus, the library surrounds a six-story atrium and connects students to collections, classrooms, faculty oﬃces, and study areas. <br><br>Collection highlights include the Rawle Collection of English and American Law from the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. The Law Library is also home to the Rawle Reading Room, which is a replica of the mid-19th century library of William Rawle, a prominent Philadelphia lawyer. <br><br>In 1972, the law school building caught ﬁre, and students, staﬀ, and other members of the Temple community made a chain to pass library books out of the burning building. They managed to save a large number of rare and valuable volumes, but more than 150,000 books were destroyed. The library has since restored and enriched its collection. <br><br></p>\r\n<h2>Temple University Libraries by the Numbers</h2>\r\n<h3>Collections</h3>\r\n<p>1,986,932 Physical titles held <br>2,279,767 Digital titles held <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Circulation</h3>\r\n<p>18,928 Lending to other libraries<br>16,274 Borrowing from other libraries <br>92,750* Circulation of physical collections <br>2,862,594 Article downloads <br><br>*The Main Campus library’s general circulating collection was closed over the summer, during the move from Paley to Charles. <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Instruction</h3>\r\n<p>28,273 Number of students served <br>1,173 Number of sessions <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Reference</h3>\r\n<p>12,511 Total reference sessions <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Website</h3>\r\n<p>963,844 Number of visits <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Digital Collections</h3>\r\n<p>94,833 Number of visits <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>eBook Use</h3>\r\n<p>1,890,526 Number of downloads <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Years of Service</h3>\r\n<p>In recognition of library staff who’ve provided exceptional service to Temple University <br>Staff member # of years <br>Sandi Thompson 50 <br>Rosa Grier 43 <br>Philip D’Andrea 40 <br>Andrea Goldstein 38 <br>Publishing <br>Temple University Press published <br>43 books <br>4 journal issues </p>\r\n<h2>Major News Round Up</h2>\r\n<p>We celebrated a number of important milestones this fiscal year, including: <br>The 50th anniversary of Temple University Press. The Press has published more than 1,600 titles in the past five decades and continues to dedicate itself to publishing socially engaged scholarship. <br><br>The 15th anniversary of the Livingstone Undergraduate Research Awards. We use these awards to encourage the use of library resources and honor Temple undergraduates’ best research projects. Jack Livingstone, SBM ’49, and Gale, a Cengage company, are longtime supporters of this initiative. <br><br>The 10th anniversary of the Beyond the Page public programming series. Our public programs, which are free and open to all, help us to serve as a multidisciplinary gathering place on campus. <br><br>Ten years since opening the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, which coincided with the opening of the Medical Education Research Building on the Health Sciences Center campus. <br><br>Five years of the PA Digital program, for which Temple Libraries plays a prominent role in managing the day to day operations. PA Digital is the Pennsylvania service hub for the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), which brings together materials from libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions around the country and makes them free and accessible. <br><br>In October, through the generous support of our donors and friends, the Libraries reached its $1.8 million endowment goal to preserve and sustain the Philadelphia Jewish Archives Collection (PJAC). We have been building the endowment fund since these valuable archives were donated to the Libraries by the Philadelphia Jewish Archives Center in 2009. Housed in the Special Collections Research Center (SCRC), this important collection documents regional Jewish history and culture. <br><br>The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection acquired a significant piece of hip hop history—material from the late rapper Tupac Shakur, including handwritten documents and jewelry. <br><br>Temple University Press and Temple University Libraries launched a joint open access imprint, North Broad Press. This new imprint furthers our ongoing efforts to support open access initiatives and reduce textbook costs for students. A call for proposals for open textbooks was issued in spring 2019, from which four titles were chosen for funding. <br><br>We debuted our university’s first Short Édition (a French publishing house of short literature) short story dispenser in the Student Center in April. Our dispenser features work from Temple writers and members of the Philadelphia writing community, as well as international content. The Libraries also ran a creative writing contest to coincide with the dispenser launch. <br><br>The Press released twenty-three more labor studies titles on its website as part of the Humanities Open Book Program. The program is jointly sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation in order to make ou-tof-print humanities books available online to a wide audience. <br><br>Seven Temple University Press books won awards, including an American Book Award for The Man-Not: Race, Class, Genre, and Dilemmas of Black Manhood by Tommy J. Curry and a CHOICE Outstanding Academic Title award for Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America Fifty Years after the Kerner Report edited by Fred Harris and Alan Curtis. <br><br>We named the Charles Library Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS): BookBot. <br><br>In September, we partnered with Temple’s Office of Sustainability to bring goats to Main Campus for two yoga sessions and some informal play time in front of Paley Library.<br><br>Ambler Campus Library staff played a critical role in helping prepare Ambler’s exhibit for the 2019 Pennsylvania Horticultural Society (PHS) Philadelphia Flower Show, the nation’s largest and longest-running horticultural event. This year’s theme was “Flower Power,” and Temple’s exhibit was titled “Hip Haven: Hangin’ Loose at a Home Refuge.”<br><br>The Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries (PACSCL) received an NEH grant to continue work on the In Her Own Right project to digitize women’s rights primary sources from over a dozen archives in the region, in preparation for the 2020 100th anniversary of women’s suffrage. The project has also received a Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR) grant that is being run out of our SCRC. For both grants, Temple Libraries is hosting project staff and Margery Sly, SCRC director, is the principal investigator. <br><br>The Libraries launched a Foods for Fines program, for which we accepted food donations at the circulation desk and waived library late fees. Donations were delivered to Cherry Pantry, the Temple community’s food pantry. The Open Access Publishing Fund, which offers funding opportunities to Temple faculty who publish in open access journals, helped cover the costs of 15 articles in 2018-2019. In May, the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library hosted a “Future Thinking for Health Sciences Librarians” conference. The conference featured guest speakers from libraries around the country who spoke about how they are planning for the health sciences libraries of tomorrow. <br><br>The Libraries launched our first-ever graduate certificate program. The Cultural Analytics Certificate (CAC) program is designed to train graduate students how to use computational methods to study images, books, objects, and other cultural products. It will be administered by the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio (formerly the Digital Scholarship Center in Paley Library) in partnership with the Klein College of Media and Communication, College of Liberal Arts, Tyler School of Art, the College of Education, the Center for the Performing and Cinematic Arts, and the College of Science and Technology. <br><br></p>\r\n<h2>New Acquisitions</h2>\r\n<p>The Libraries’ special collections include the Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) and the Charles L. Blockson Afro- American Collection. The SCRC houses the Libraries’ rare books, manuscripts, archives, university records, and important regional collections such as the Urban Archives and the Philadelphia Jewish Archives. The Blockson Collection holds a variety of rare and contemporary publications, photographs, archives, and manuscripts documenting the histories of peoples of African descent. Recent acquisitions help build these valuable collections for students, scholars, and members of the broader community engaged in research. <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Select Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) Acquisitions</h3>\r\n<p>Among the over 100 collections acquired and purchased during the past year: <br><br>Electric Factory and Larry Magid Entertainment business records and posters, 1960s–2018 <br>Larry Magid donated approximately 900 posters, photographs, and objects from his and other local and national concert venues and promotions dating from the early days of the Electric Factory to the present. The collection also includes recent business records. <br><br>Movement Theatre International records, c. 1979– 2007 <br>Michael Pedretti donated the records of Movement Theatre International in <br>Philadelphia and its predecessor programs, documenting its production of mime, vaudeville, clown theater, and contemporary dance.

The collection includes photo albums, press clippings, publications and fyers, administrative fles and budgets, grant fles, minutes, website, slides and photographs, oral histories, and videos. <br><br></p>\r\n<h3>Select Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection Acquisitions</h3>\r\n<p>Letter from Zora Neale Hurston <br>This letter by Zora Neale Hurston, the Harlem Renaissance writer, to The Sentinel was reprinted by the Richmond Times Dispatch on Monday, August 23, 1955. In the letter, Hurston denounces the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, which ruled that state laws that established racial segregation in public schools were unconstitutional even if the segregated schools are otherwise citing equal in quality. Hurston argues that Blacks should not ﬁght to be included in white spaces since whites do not accept them in these spaces and that Black schools would very much improve if they remained segregated. <br><br>Ephemeral items relating to African American newspapers <br>The collection includes a circular letter from Washington Rhodes, the editor of the Philadelphia Tribune, titled “What would happen if all Negro Newspapers would cease publication?”; a 28-page pamphlet entitled “Careers for Negroes in Newspapers,” published by the American Newspaper Guild; a 36-page document published in 1932 by W.B. Ziﬀ Co, entitled “The Negro market, published in the interest of the Negro Press;” and an Afro-American newspaper advertising rate card citing the rates of four newspapers in Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and Richmond. <br><br>Letter to Thomas W. Harvey of Philadelphia from Marcus Garvey, Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) and African Communities’ League (ACL) president <br>The letter tasks Harvey with securing subscriptions for the Black Man and collecting the names, job titles, and addresses of individuals who are interested in working with the UNIA in Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., and Virginia. Thomas W. Harvey succeeded Garvey, serving from 1952 until 1978 as President General of the UNIA and ACL. Harvey was also the president of Division 121 of Philadelphia. <br><br>Portrait collection <br>This collection of black and white portraits was taken in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; St. Louis, Missouri; Youngstown, Ohio; New York, New York; and the Washington, D.C. area. The portrait of the Dorsey family is the most notable. Thomas J. Dorsey was born into slavery in 1812 in Maryland. In 1836, he ran away from his owner and moved to Philadelphia, where a group of abolitionists bought his freedom.

Scott Stephenson <br>When the Museum of the American Revolution acquired the land at Third and Chestnut streets in Olde City, Philadelphia, it came with the condition that an archaeological investigation be conducted. The excavation that began in the summer of 2014 yielded treasures in the trash: unearthed privy pits provided remarkable finds from a mid-eighteenth-century tavern to relics from a button factory dating to the early twentieth century. Yamin, lead archaeologist on the dig, catalogues items— including earthenware plates and jugs, wig curlers, clay pipes, and liquor bottles—to tell the stories of their owners and their roles in Philadelphia history. <br><br>Not from Here, Not from There/ No Soy de Aquí ni de Allá: The Autobiography of Nelson A. Díaz <br>Nelson A.

Programs explored the legacy of the Kerner Commission, the Olympic protest, and more. <br><br>Celebrating new additions to the public domain <br>On January 31, we held a party to celebrate the hundreds of thousands of books, music, movies, and art—first published in 1923—finally entering the public domain. All these materials are now free of copyright restrictions and accessible to use or remix for any purpose. <br><br>Reflecting on the post Korean War experiences of families in South Korea <br><br>A Long Separation <br>At the beginning of the spring semester, we hosted an interactive photo exhibit by photographer and filmmaker Laura Elizabeth Pohl in Paley Library.

The story continues on pp. 3–5.</p>\r\n<h3>15 Years Honoring Undergraduate Research</h3>\r\n<p>For 15 years running, the Libraries have encouraged the use of library resources while honoring Temple undergraduates' best research projects. Originally called the Library Prize for Undergraduate Research, this initiative is now known as the Livingstone Undergraduate Research Awards. We renamed the awards in 2015 in honor of longtime donor Jack Livingstone, SBM '49, who established an endowment fund to support the awards in perpetuity. Gale, a Cengage company, has also supported these awards for the past nine years.</p>\r\n<p>At this year's award ceremony in April, Jack Livingstone told the story of arriving at Temple after his service in World War II. He was grateful for the chance to go to col\u00adlege, and has always wanted to give back to the university who gave him so much. \"I am honored to have this award in my name,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>The Livingstone Awards have become increasingly competitive, drawing around 100 applicants in recent years. The award categories have evolved, and currently include the humanities; the social sciences; the STEM disciplines; creative works and media production; general education courses; and diversity and social justice, which debuted just this year and is sponsored by Gale.</p>\r\n<p>Winners are awarded prize money, ranging from $500 to $1,000, and an opportunity to present their work. Over the years, the awards ceremony and reception has become the Libraries' signature event and is attended by winners and their families, sponsoring faculty members, Temple administration, library staff, and other guests. It is a wonderful occasion to hear about the excellent work our Temple students are engaged in, and we look forward to many more years celebrating their accomplishments.</p>\r\n<h3>Where Are They Now? Former Livingstone Award Winners Check In, Share Impact</h3>\r\n<h4>Ryan Drummond, TYL '06, 2006 winner for \"Interstate Station Stop: A Voyage into the American Frontier Myth\"</h4>\r\n<p>Ryan received his Masters in Architecture at Cornell University. He is currently a licensed architect in both New York and Pennsylvania, working in practice and serving as adjunct faculty periodically at Temple and Drexel University.</p>\r\n<p>–\"Part of the experience of winning the Prize that was especially fulfilling was being able to interact with those in other disciplines and get a taste for the other undergraduate research that was going on at Temple at the time.\"</p>\r\n<h4>Steven Horowitz, CLA '06, 2005 winner for \"Rethinking Lockean Copyright and Fair Use\" and 2006 winner for \"As Boundaries Fade: The Social Contract in Cyberspace\"</h4>\r\n<p>Steven graduated first in his class at Harvard Law School and is currently a partner at global law firm, Sidley Austin LLP, where he helps life sciences and technology companies in disputes over intellectual property and competition.</p>\r\n<p>–\"The Library Prize supported my research into the philosophy of copyright, which put me on a path to law school and a career in intellectual property.\"</p>\r\n<p>–\"The library—especially in the days before the TECH Center—was my home away from home.

Winning the Livingstone Award felt like an affirmation of all that hard work and enabled me to have the confidence to pursue new projects throughout my undergraduate and graduate careers.\"</p>\r\n<p>–\"Meeting the other Award winners and learning about their research during the ceremony was a great experience. Listening to one of my thesis advisors give remarks about working together was also very heart-warming.\"</p>\r\n<h4>Paige Hill, CLA '18, 2018 winner for \"Gender Quotas as Strategy: Exploring the Relationship Among International Perceptions of Democracy, Transnational Influence, and Female Representation in Sub-Saharan Africa\"</h4>\r\n<p>Paige is working as a research assistant in the Niehaus Center for Globalization at Princeton University and plans to pursue either a graduate degree in public policy or international relations, or a PhD in Political Science.</p>\r\n<p>–\"When I won the Livingstone Award for the Social Sciences...it was the first time I real\u00adized I was capable of producing impactful, publication-worthy research, and that people would be willing to read it. As an undergraduate student, the Livingstone Award meant that the world of academia and research suddenly opened itself up to me as a possible career path, one that I hadn't considered prior to the award.\"</p>\r\n<h3>Temple University Press Celebrates 50th Anniversary</h3>\r\n<p>with Mary Rose Muccie, Director</p>\r\n<p>Temple University Press was officially founded in 1969 and this year marks our 50th anniversary.

Since that auspicious beginning, Temple University Press has dedicated itself to publishing socially engaged scholarship.</p>\r\n<p>Our catalog is filled with titles related to social justice and social change. We pride ourselves on being pioneers in advancing the scholarly value and social importance of disciplines such as women's studies, ethnic studies, and the study of race. To that end, we launched highly regarded lists in African American studies and Latin American and Latino/a studies and a field-shaping series in Asian American studies. We've been recognized for publishing award-winning titles in urban studies, political science, and gender and sexuality studies. And, we have the premiere list of titles on Philadelphia and the region, from arts and culture to history and sports and more.</p>\r\n<p>We're commemorating this momentous occasion in a number of ways throughout the year, including an open house in September in our new home in the magnificent Charles Library and a panel and reception in October featuring scholars and authors speaking on the impact of the Press in both scholarly publishing and the Philadelphia and regional community.</p>\r\n<h3>Beyond the Page Turns 10</h3>\r\n<p>2019 marks another important milestone—10 years since we launched our public programming series, Beyond the Page. The series was named by Philadelphia advertising legend George Beach and continues to feature a wide vari\u00adety of academic and cultural programs.</p>\r\n<p>One of the Libraries' core values is to serve as a multidisciplinary gathering place on campus. Our public programs, which are free and open to all, help us do just that. We have also expanded our programming to include workshops, scholarly communications initiatives, and more.</p>\r\n<p>It is especially fitting we celebrate this significant anniversary as we wrapped our last season in Paley Library. We are thrilled to move our Main Campus operations into Charles Library later this year, where we will continue to offer high quality lectures, author talks, panels, workshops, performances, and more in our wonderful new event space.</p>\r\n<p>See what we have planned next at <a href=\"library.temple.edu/beyondthepage\">library.temple.edu/beyondthepage</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>10 Years in Ginsburg Library</h3>\r\n<p>with Barbara Kuchan, Director</p>\r\n<p>The Ginsburg Health Sciences Library is celebrating 10 wonderful years. Coinciding with the opening of the Medical Education Research Building (MERB) in 2009, the Ginsburg Library combined the collections of the Kresge Library (main health sciences library) and the South Branch (with holdings in dentistry, pharmacy, and allied health). The two prior sites had a combined footprint of roughly 30,000 square feet with cramped accommodations for collaborative study, restricted quiet study space, and limited natural light.</p>\r\n<p>While planning the new 53,000 square foot library, architects and library administrators were able to take advantage of the trend toward digitally available content by placing older, bound journal volumes in compact shelving, and expanding user seating spaces to include large tables, study carrels, and group study rooms.</p>\r\n<p>The space is filled with natural light and offers a range of services from expert health sciences librarians. In 2017, the Library opened an Innovation Space with 3D printing and virtual and augmented reality systems.</p>\r\n<p>The Ginsburg Library is taking a moment during this significant birthday to connect with faculty and students on what they see is important in spaces and technology, and what they dream the library could be. Using heat mapping exercises, focus groups, whiteboard exercises, and individual meetings, library staff are observing and listening to what is important to constituents, and developing action plans as needed.</p>\r\n<p>All of this input is being collected and organized, and will be reviewed by library leadership to determine what recommended course of action should be taken to ensure that the next 10 years are equally successful.</p>\r\n<h3>Five Years with PA Digital</h3>\r\n<p>This year, we celebrate five years of the PA Digital program. PA Digital is the Pennsylvania service hub for the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA), which brings together materials from libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions around the country and makes them free and accessible. Temple Libraries plays a prominent role in PA Digital's day to day operations.</p>\r\n<p>So far, we have collected over 376,000 digital objects in 727 digital collections from 83 Pennsylvania institutions and made them available in the DPLA. We have also expanded our outreach and curation efforts, including the creation of four primary source sets (with plans for more) that highlight PA Digital materials for K-12 educators.</p>\r\n<p>Explore our content at <a href=\"padigital.org\">padigital.org</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>2019: The year we open Charles Library on Temple's Main Campus!</h3>\r\n<h2>Welcome from the Dean</h2>\r\n<p>Dear Friends,</p>\r\n<p>Welcome to the summer 2019 issue of Speaking Volumes. It's hard to believe, but this will be the last issue we send to you before the big move of Paley Library, our current Main Campus library, into the new Charles Library. We've been sharing updates about the new library with you for several years now; I'm thrilled that this historic moment—the opening of this incredible new structure—has nearly arrived.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to opening Charles Library, 2019 is a significant year for the Libraries in many other ways. Temple University Press celebrates its 50th anniversary publishing scholarly and regional titles this year. 2019 also marks 15 years of supporting and rewarding excellence in undergraduate research through the Livingstone Undergraduate Research Awards (formerly the Library Prize for Undergraduate Research).</p>\r\n<p>We are also looking back at 10 years of Beyond the Page public programming and 10 years since opening the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library on Temple's Health Sciences Campus. It is fitting that such a momentous year gives us the opportunity to both look back at the history of the Libraries and ahead toward an extraordinary future.</p>\r\n<p>This issue also highlights digitization projects at the Blockson Collection, emerging issues in the academic library landscape, a joint Libraries-Press imprint, the launch of Temple's first short story dispenser, and other new and ongoing initiatives.</p>\r\n<p>This is a wonderful moment for us, and I look forward to sharing stories and scenes from the new Charles Library in our next issue, in addition to all the important, continuing work going on within our library enterprise.</p>\r\n<p>Stay well,</p>\r\n<p>Joe Lucia</p>\r\n<p>Dean of University Libraries</p>\r\n<h2>Charles Library Nears Completion</h2>\r\n<p>With its sweeping wooden arched entrances, rough stone facade, and massive panes of glass, the new Charles Library is a grand sight at the heart of Temple's Main Campus. It has been an incredible experience watching this building, which spans an entire city block, take shape. And, we are just a few months away from opening Charles to the public.</p>\r\n<p>Charles Library will revitalize the heart of Temple's Main Campus and expand the seating capacity of Paley Library; offer a variety of forward-thinking, technologically sophisticated spaces; collocate academic services; employ a variety of strategies for storing, accessing, and preserving its robust, rich special and general collections; and boast prominent, dedicated programmatic space and outdoor areas for gathering and learning.</p>\r\n<p>The focus right now is both final interior work, furnishings, and the complex process of moving Paley Library's collections and staff into the new building. After closing Paley in May, we began moving our collections, many of which are being loaded into the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS), also known as BookBot, while others are designated for open browsing stacks on the library's fourth floor.</p>\r\n<p>Staff will move into the building later in the summer. There are plans for a formal dedication in September, as well as an opening celebration for the entire community in early fall. We cannot wait to open Charles Library's doors to the public and invite you in to see this breathtaking new space for yourself.</p>\r\n<h3>Gifts to the Library Endowment</h3>\r\n<p>In addition to Steve Charles' incredible gift to name the new library, we have received other generous gifts to support the library endowment, including other naming gifts, that will provide perpetual funding to operate Charles Library at its optimal level, along with all the valuable resources it will house.</p>\r\n<p>There are a number of opportunities to support this effort either through naming gifts or gifts to support the endowment at any level. To learn more, visit <a href=\"library.temple.edu/newlibrary\">library.temple.edu/newlibrary</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Saying Goodbye to Paley Library</h3>\r\n<p>On May 9, we hosted a \"Goodbye to Paley\" open house, in order to offer the Temple community one last chance to celebrate and to say goodbye to the building that has been the library's home on Main Campus since 1966.</p>\r\n<p>The open house featured a video booth for sharing Paley memories and an SCRC photo exhibit. Visitors also had the chance to take a piece of Paley with them—Temple Surplus was on hand to facilitate a furniture sale, featuring Gunlocke chairs, card catalogs, and more.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the day, we officially closed Paley Library in order to begin the move to Charles Library. The move process will continue throughout the summer, as we work toward opening the new library for the fall semester in August.</p>\r\n<p>Temple will continue to celebrate the generosity of the Samuel Paley Foundation and the Paley family by renaming the former library building \"Samuel Paley Hall.\" The building will be the new home for the College of Public Health and will continue to house the Center for Academic Advising and Professional Development for the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Science and Technology.</p>\r\n<h2>Mapping the SCRC Move to Charles Library</h2>\r\n<p>with Margery Sly, Director of SCRC</p>\r\n<p>Planning to move Paley's impressive number of 1.5 million volumes from its general collections into the new Charles Library is a study in time and motion. The work of the Special Collections Research Center (SCRC) staff to map collections into several new spaces in Charles—from both Paley and the library depository—has been equally interesting and full of unique complexities.</p>\r\n<p>A \"pre-move move\" in late March–early April resulted in the repositioning of over 100 pieces of university and library art work and 5,000 feet of archives to the library depository. And the main move this summer offers the opportunity to improve storage and enhance accessibility for our users.</p>\r\n<p>To identify which archives collections to house in Charles, SCRC staff studied robust collection use statistics—both individual and class—from our online registration and request system as well as format, preservation data, and other information. The rare book vault will enable us to combine a strong collection of over 3,000 feet of books supporting study of the history of the book, book illustration, and book forms among other topics into one secure space.</p>\r\n<p>The compact shelving will house 13,000 frequently-used archives collections, such as university history materials, Occupy Philadelphia's archives, and additional book collections. And the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) will store up to 18,000 feet of frequently-used archives material, as well as material awaiting processing and cataloging. Our remaining book and archives collections will continue to be stored in the depository.</p>\r\n<h2>In the Field: Toward Sustainable Journal Costs, Open Access</h2>\r\n<p>This is a new column we're launching to highlight trends and issues in academic libraries across the country, with an eye toward our work here at Temple Libraries.</p>\r\n<p>Academic libraries are committed to providing their patrons with access to scholarly resources. While library budgets have remained static (or even decreased) over the past several decades, the costs of online scholarly journal subscriptions have continued to rise. Because a few big publishers control the whole publishing enterprise, costs are skyrocketing, pricing isn't transparent, and publicly funded-research sits behind a paywall. Steven Bell, associate university librarian, notes \"the fact that the system is largely inaccessible to most is in conflict with the basic values of librarianship.\"</p>\r\n<p>The growing pushback against exorbitant subscription pricing is linked with a call for more open access to research. In late February, the University of California system announced Elsevier's (one of the top publishers) pricing was no longer sustainable and that it sought to make UC faculty's research openly accessible. After stalled negotiations, UC cancelled its subscriptions. While other universities have made similar breaks in favor of more open access models, the UC story brought the issue national coverage.</p>\r\n<p>At Temple, we have joined a growing number of university libraries in choosing to break the \"Big Deal\" with Elsevier. The Big Deal was initially sold to universities as a way to bundle lots of content at a reduced price. But the cost of this predetermined bundle has continued to rise dramatically.</p>\r\n<p>According to Head of Acquisitions and Collection Development Brian Schoolar, the Libraries' decision is about controlling costs. \"The budget we allocate to our existing subscriptions impinges on any flexibility we have to buy anything new. We can't have so much of our budget locked into four or five publishers.\"</p>\r\n<p>In breaking the Big Deal, we subscribe to a smaller number of select journals, though often at higher individual costs. We are regularly reviewing usage patterns of these journals to identify the most cost-effective method of providing Temple faculty and researchers with access to the scholarly articles they need for their research.</p>\r\n<p>We are also investing in open access initiatives. Our Open Access Publishing Fund helps faculty pay the fees to publish their articles in open access journals. Another project in development is an institutional repository, into which Temple faculty members may deposit articles they've authored that will be openly accessible.</p>\r\n<p>\"While issues around costs and access are far from resolved,\" Bell notes, \"these developments are tipping the scale in favor of openness. And the Libraries are working to build more of a culture of openness here at Temple.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Rare Pamphlets from the Blockson Collection Digitized, Openly Accessible</h2>\r\n<p>Recently, we made an important addition to our Digital Collections: 289 of the rarest and most fragile pamphlets in the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection. This pamphlet collection contains maps and lithographs, ranging from \"A further salutation of brotherly love\" (a pamphlet produced by the Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia in 1795) to the American Liberty Almanac for 1846 to meeting minutes from anti-slavery conventions. In digitizing the collection, we preserve and make available these rare materials for current and future generations of scholars.</p>\r\n<p>The Blockson Collection houses over 600,000 items, including books, manuscripts, pamphlets, journals, photographs, and more, that document the history and culture of Africans and African Americans. According to Curator Diane Turner, \"A major goal is to make the Blockson Collection's unique items more accessible to faculty, students, and researchers at Temple University and beyond. We are picking up momentum through projects such as this.\"</p>\r\n<p>This recent digitization project was a collaborative effort, led by Serkaddis Alemayehu, the Blockson Collection's public history coordinator and digital archives specialist, along with Librarian Aslaku Berhanu, Bibliographic Assistant III Michael Carroll, and the Digitization and Metadata Services team.</p>\r\n<p>We are proud to offer free access to these incredible resources. Visit <a href=\"digital.library.temple.edu%22\">digital.library.temple.edu</a> to view these and other collections.</p>\r\n<h2>North Broad Press: First Titles Selected</h2>\r\n<p>Temple University Press and Temple University Libraries have recently launched a joint open access imprint, North Broad Press. This new imprint will further our ongoing efforts to support open access initiatives and reduce textbook costs for students.</p>\r\n<p>The first titles to be published by North Broad Press have been selected. A call for proposals for open textbooks was issued in spring 2019 and resulted in 19 submissions, from which four were chosen for funding. Two additional open textbooks are already in process. Open textbooks save students money and improve learning outcomes by ensuring that all students have access to their textbook on the first day of class.</p>\r\n<p>The titles to be published include textbooks in civil engineering, physics, social work, economics, and criminal justice. They will be written or edited by Temple faculty. These textbooks will be used in courses at Temple and potentially at other universities throughout North America.</p>\r\n<p>All North Broad Press books will be released online on the Press's instance of the digital platform Manifold, which allows users to read, annotate, and share them. View our projects at <a href=\"temple.manifoldapp.org\">temple.manifoldapp.org</a>.</p>\r\n<p>A second call for proposals will be issued in spring 2020.</p>\r\n<h2>News in Brief</h2>\r\n<h3>Temple's First Short Story Dispenser</h3>\r\n<p>We debuted our university's first Short Édition short story dispenser in the Student Center in April. Short Édition is a French publishing house of short literature, and their dispenser prints a free short story or poem at just the push of a button. Our dispenser features work from Temple writers and members of the Philadelphia writing community, as well as international content.</p>\r\n<p>The Libraries also ran a creative writing contest to coincide with our dispenser launch. The theme for the contest—\"transformation\"— celebrated the new Charles Library and the ways in which it will transform Temple's campus. Twenty-five submissions (out of 100) were selected to be added to our dispenser.</p>\r\n<h3>New Graduate Certificate in Cultural Analytics</h3>\r\n<p>This spring, the Libraries announced our first-ever gradu\u00adate certificate program. The new Cultural Analytics Certificate (CAC) program is designed to train graduate students how to use computational methods to study images, books, objects, and other cultural products. It will be administered by the Scholars Studio (formerly the Digital Scholarship Center in Paley Library) in partnership with the Klein College of Media and Communication, College of Liberal Arts, Tyler School of Art, the College of Education, the Center for the Performing and Cinematic Arts, and the College of Science and Technology.</p>\r\n<h3>Library Board of Visitors Welcomes Two New Members</h3>\r\n<p>The Library Board of Visitors serve as ambassadors for the Libraries, as they guide and counsel us in our work and help secure philanthropic support. This year, we are pleased to welcome two new members to the board: Susan Popkin and Mickey Langsfeld. Susan and Mickey have both been integral members and served on the board for the Philadelphia Jewish Archives Center, which donated its archives to the Special Collections Research Center in 2009. We look forward to the expertise and enthusiasm they will bring to the Libraries in their new roles.</p>\r\n<h2>Our Donors Speak Volumes</h2>\r\n<p>We are grateful for our friends and philanthropic supporters whose gifts impact us in a variety of meaningful ways.

This year's theme was \"Flower Power,\" and Temple's exhibit was titled \"Hip Haven: Hangin' Loose at a Home Refuge.\"</p>\r\n<p>Once we conceived of something \"heavy\" to demonstrate in the Temple University exhibit at the PHS Philadelphia Flower Show this year, like at least the last seven, the Ambler Library staff got hip to it. From the stacks and through email came books about the numerous positive effects of nature on people, the urgent need to address climate change, and the roots and fruits of the environ\u00admental movement that occurred alongside \"flower power,\" the show theme. Students sought inspirational photographs for exhibit elements from books and peri\u00adodicals, which they translated into drawings, and then eventually, forms, materials, and fasteners that close to 250,000 flower show visitors could scrutinize between March 2 and 11.</p>\r\n<p>And, as they do every year, Ambler Library Staff volun\u00adteered to monitor the exhibit, pointed visitors toward the interpretive signage, and answered questions. Everyone dug the five awards the exhibit garnered: a PHS Gold Medal; the PHS Gold Medal Plant Award; The Bulkley Medal of the Garden Club of America; Special Achievement Award of the Garden Club Federation of Pennsylvania; and PHS Sustainability Award.</p>",

        "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">August 2020</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This time last year, we kicked off the fall semester with the opening of the landmark new Charles Library on Main Campus. It was a joyous celebration of Temple’s commitment to learning, knowledge, and the future of academic libraries.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But in the spring semester, we had to close the new library and all our library locations as Temple grappled with the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic alongside our city, country, and world. It was a spring and summer like no other. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, we are carefully welcoming students and faculty back for the 2020-2021 academic year. While the upcoming semesters are sure to be full of challenges, we here at Temple Libraries are committed to providing you with important services and resources to help you succeed, whether you are on campus or off. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our <a href=\"../../../categories/12\">library locations</a> are all open again, though with limited hours and reduced capacity. We have a number of safety measures in place to protect all our visitors, and I encourage you to read more about <a href=\"../../../categories/47\">what to expect when visiting us in person</a> as well as changes to services and access to spaces. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are looking for research materials, a good place to start is <a href=\"http://librarysearch.temple.edu\">Library Search</a>. Here, you can browse books, media, articles, journals, databases, and even materials in the <a href=\"../../../scrc\">Special Collections Research Center (SCRC)</a> and the <a href=\"../../../collections/blockson\">Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection</a>. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those who are attending classes and teaching remotely this fall, we’ve also compiled some <a href=\"../../../webpages/61\">helpful fully online resources</a>. This page highlights our online collections and also includes specific support for students and faculty.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As always, <a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/people?specialists=true\">subject librarians</a> and subject matter experts are available for questions and virtual research consultations. Visit our <a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/contact-us\">Contact Us</a> page to find staff members, book an appointment, or to chat, text, email, or call us. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Libraries also continue to offer a variety of free events and workshops as part of the <a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/events\">Beyond the Page</a> public programming series. This fall, we are exploring the theme of Interruption, and all events will take place virtually. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those interested in making use of the Libraries’ advanced equipment and technology, you can still visit the <a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/lcdss\">Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio</a> in Charles Library and the <a href=\"http://guides.temple.edu/innovationspace\">Innovation Space</a> at Ginsburg Health Sciences Library—just be sure to make an appointment ahead of time.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, if you want even more library news and updates, be sure to follow the Libraries on <a href=\"http://instagram.com/tulibraries/\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"http://facebook.com/templelibraries/\">Facebook</a>, and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/TempleLibraries\">Twitter</a>. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We look forward to helping support you and your academic work this coming year. And remember, we are in this together, so we can be together. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With warm regards,</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Joe Lucia</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dean of University Libraries</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The TULUP D&amp;I Committee facilitated the creation of a Diversity Statement in order to guide TULUP’s commitment to the range of human representations in all areas of our work. In an effort to exemplify a commitment to engaging diverse voices, all TULUP staff were invited to share their input on the statement. The TULUP D&amp;I Committee used these suggestions to shape the Diversity Statement you see below and continues to work diligently to facilitate TULUP’s upholding of the principles within it.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Diversity Statement</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The staff of Temple University Libraries and Press strive to engage, include, and serve the full diversity of the Temple academic and local communities regardless of race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, socioeconomic status, veteran status, culture, language, political views, citizenship status, or diverse abilities.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We are dedicated to the principles and practices of social justice, diversity, and equity among our staff, collections, and services.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">While our staff is not as diverse as the communities we serve, we are working toward our commitment to the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We hope to act as a catalyst to our users to challenge their own assumptions and viewpoints, while also intentionally building collections and services that let users see themselves reflected. We strive to create safe spaces in our buildings and on our websites, and do not tolerate harassment or hate speech in any form.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We're fully committed to eliminating barriers to learning and fostering access for our communities. The development of a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment is a continuous process. We’re taking small steps every day towards our goals, including regular attention to these issues and calls to action from our standing Diversity and Inclusion Committee.</p>\r\n<h2 class=\"p2\">How could we be doing better?</h2>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Let us know at <a href=\"mailto:asktulibrary@temple.edu\"><span class=\"s1\">asktulibrary@temple.edu</span></a>.</p>",

        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Note: This program no longer exists. Graduate students interested in receiving training in digital methods should consider applying for our <a href=\"../../../services/graduate-extern-program\">Graduate Extern Program</a> and enrolling in the <a href=\"../../../categories/cultural-analytics-certificate-program\">Cultural Analytics Certificate Program</a>. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Digital Scholars Program was a collaboration between the Center for the Humanities at Temple and the Scholars Studio of Temple Libraries. It trained graduate students at Temple to apply digital research methods to humanistic or artistic material for their own research or creative projects. Participants met weekly in the Fall for an introduction to digital research techniques. In Spring, students worked on their own projects and met every two weeks. At the end of the year, all participants presented their projects to the scholarly community.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2018-2019:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jessica L. Sitek, PhD, Religion</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a third year PhD student in the Department of Religion, participation in this year’s Digital Scholars program will serve as part of my dissertation work. The proposed project uses postwar chaplaincy materials (manuals, pamphlets, histories, etc.) to examine how normative definitions of religion are formed, and specifically how official definitions are formed and function in a society that supposedly maintains separation of Church and State. This project is meant to serve as a foundation for broader work that considers the institutionalization of the chaplaincy as a clinical role, and its implications for care delivery.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Maik A Lally, PhD, Art History</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The topic of this digital scholarship project is to track the trade of devotional art, coins, and ideas that originated in Constantinople and spread through the Eastern Mediterranean on an interactive map. Comparing coins and art from different eras enables a view of the city’s economy throughout its life while studying the spread of ideas allows for the conducting of research into a non-intrinsic trade system. One can compare the spread of artistic and theological ideas that occurred on these trade routes by analyzing artwork of churches in both Constantinople and the periphery regions.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Manna Duah, PhD, History</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My project uses data and network analysis to map eight incidents of mass political mobilizations among African students in US international education programs between 1960 and 1975.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Megan E. Reddicks Pignataro, PhD, Art History </h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My digital project coincides with a chapter of my dissertation on how sculptors, like Donatello, in fifteenth century Florence created the impression of three-dimensions on a two-dimensional surface. I will examine a contemporary sculpture at the National Gallery of Art, DC, and create a digital 3D model to capture not only the spatial recession in the work, but also the sculpting textures themselves. This will help to visualize the artistic technique as well as demonstrate the early impact of sculpture in the history of optical perspective in Renaissance art.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Urszula Pruchniewska, PhD,  Media and Communication</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project examines the #metoo movement on Twitter, identifying and analyzing the tweets in the key moments of the movement using both an automated content analysis and critical discourse analysis.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Yang Shan Chou,  MFA, Graphic &amp; Interactive Design</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My idea is to create an art project using physical computing, such as Arduino’s, to explore the idea of the uncanny valley. The “uncanny valley” is defined as a phenomenon that occurs when a humanoid object resembles a human being, causing an unsettling effect for the viewers. Our experimental process will determine the form that the Uncanny Valley</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">phenomenon will take in our project. This project will be split into three parts: 1) starting the experiment, 2) forming it into a story, and 3) finally, creating an interactive display that will enable us to make modifications based on the audience’s feedback.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Elizabeth J. White Vidarte</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project is a test-run for a larger comparative project that will include patient memoirs, diaries, and letters. It uses computational textual analysis on primary sources in the history of psychiatric medicine to explore the  rhetorics of care and dependency in different medical subcultures. Analyzing a corpus of nursing care manuals in contrast to a corpus of American Journal of Insanity volumes, all published between 1880 and 1950, this project asks: What kinds of differences are there in content and attitude between primarily male doctors and primarily female nurses? How do we account for those differences and how do they map across time?</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2017-2018:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jeff P. Antsen, PhD, Political Science</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">U.S. history is punctuated by conflict over the social worth and legal equality of historically stigmatized and marginalized groups.  The way media outlets discuss stigmatized groups can promote – or undermine – public affect and support for them. In my dissertation, Why Bother Choosing Anyway? : LGBT Community Framing, and the Role of Etiological Narrative Exposure, I study the different narratives that media outlets have drawn on over time, regarding the LGBT community.  I study the ways LGBT issues are framed, and the aspects of the community that are focused on in mass communications.  I use content analysis of media publications over the last 40 years to help understand how narratives have arisen, interacted, and diminished: over time, across the country, and in response to historical events.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Ania Korsunska, PhD, Media and Communications</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I am second year PhD student in the Media and Communication department. My research focus is on how medical misinformation disseminates throughout various media outlets. Specifically focusing on studies of viral events, social media network analysis, information diffusion, and information “network” gatekeeping. Currently exploring R and Python programming languages, as well as network analysis/data visualization software such as Gephi.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Andrew Litts, PhD, Music Composition and Theory</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Data sonifiers seek aural applicability of their data, mapping research findings and other forms of data onto sonic parameters such as frequency, amplitude, rhythm, and timbre. A common thread among discussions in the field is the relevance of data sonification to music: at what point does the sonification become music, if it even should? I am sonifying the open-source data provided by SEPTA, Philadelphia’s public transit authority, to turn real-time data about train location and timeliness into sound users can use on their ride to find out the status of their train or to learn about the system in whole.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Emily Logan, MS, Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Alodia Martin-Martinez, PhD, Spanish and Portuguese</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Connor L. D. Phillips, PhD, Media and Communications</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fake news has become a hot topic of conversation, especially on social media, but are we all describing the same thing? Judging from the many news sources who have been labelled “fake news” – from the New York Times and CNN to Breitbart – it would appear the term has no clear, singular meaning. The goal of this project is to understand what those meanings are and how people use them. I am using digital techniques to scrape social networking sites, like Twitter and Reddit, identify influencers, and analyze and visualize the different meanings and uses of “fake news.”</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Keisha Wiel, Ph.D, Anthropology</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keisha studies the relationship between language and identity in Aruba and Curaçao and its effects on language policy and education.  More specifically, I research how people discuss and debate issues and ideologies surrounding Papiamentu, the official language in Aruba and Curaçao, on Facebook.  How are people discussing the creole language compared to the colonial languages present on the islands? I want to further analyze whether these ideological debates mirror the sentiments of the speakers and if they affect language policies in education.  I then use this data to research whether these ideologies are subsequently reinforced in a classroom setting.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Rachel Wildfeuer, PhD, Sociology</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rachel Wildfeuer’s planned dissertation will analyze the influence of place in the United States using the concept of the American Dream. Rachel, a PhD student in the department of sociology, plans to explore the extent to which place matters for the American Dream (confidence in it and achievement of it) because of the people that live there, because of the context of the place, and because of changes over time. Her digital project will include textual analysis of the concept of the American Dream and mapping geocoded data to visualize the influence of place.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2016-2017:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Juan Larrosa-Fuentes, PhD, SMC clinton and latino media</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Robert W. Jagiela, MA, English sent analysis and novel</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Catherine Murray PhD History captivity narratives</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Paige Gibson, PhD, SMC German memory</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Elizabeth Forano, PhD, Education teacher service learning</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Hojeong Lee, PhD, SMC korean social media</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Alexandra Straub, PhD, History restoration/economic growth</h3>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2015-2016:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Minju Bae PhD, History</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Maeve Coudrelle PhD, Art History</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Nicole Lemire Garlic MA, Media Studies and Production</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite progress toward racial justice and reconciliation in U.S. society, there is much more work to be done. No truer is this in areas where race intersects with the law, as in community-police relations, courtrooms, and congressional debates. Using text mining, topic modeling, network analysis, and other digital tools, I explore the different dimensions and definitions of racial justice and reconciliation in law-related contexts. I further study the strategic use of visual and textual media in racial justice and reconciliation efforts.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Amy Gillette PhD, Art History</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Christopher Roberts PhD, African American Studies</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Hilary Symes PhD, Anthropology</h3>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Scholars 2014-2015:</h2>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bradley Cavallo – Art History</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Ted Howell – English</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Kaelin Jewell – Art History</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kaelin Jewell is an art historian who specializes in the visual culture of the late antique and early medieval Mediterranean. She is interested in how digital tools, such as architectural visualizations and photogrammetry, can help to better understand past urban environments, many of which are no longer visible. In her dissertation, “Architectural Decorum and Aristocratic Power in Late Antiquity: The Gens Anicii,” Kaelin explores the architectural and artistic mechanics of power and display as employed by the aristocratic families of cities such as Rome, Ravenna, and Constantinople during the 4th through the late-6th centuries CE. It is through new and exciting digital tools and the support of Temple’s Digital Scholarship Center, that Kaelin will be able to conceptualize and visualize the lost monuments, urban topographies, and complex family histories of late antiquity. Currently, Kaelin is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Art History at the Tyler School of Art and holds an M.A. in Art History, a B.F.A. in Photography and a B.A. in Archaeology (all from the University of Louisville). She has participated in on-site seminars in Istanbul and Cappadocia in addition to conducting research for her dissertation in Italy and Croatia, generously funded by the International Center for Medieval Art.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Melissa Meade – Media and Communication</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Labaron Palmer – Geography and Urban Studies</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jaclyn Partyka – MFA, English</h3>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Joyce Rasing – Geography</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Joyce Rasing is a graduate student in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies, pursing a Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems. She also received her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the College of Liberal Arts here at Temple in December 2014. Past projects include using ArcGIS for various mapping projects for the City of Philadelphia and non-profit organizations ranging from poverty and insurance coverage to education and targeted outreach while making use of census data and organization-based data. Other projects included organizational social media analyses via Google and Twitter APIs. She is interested in linking violent non-state actors (VNSAs, such as terrorist groups, insurgencies, or criminal organizations) to geography using social network analysis based on mode of attack and target type by location and how certain groups have changed over the course of time.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e9304061-7fff-b8c9-30db-c99b9034e205\"></span></p>",

The Tuttleman side of the library will remain open throughout the summer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What about the collections?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Access to the Main Campus circulating collections are now closed until the opening of Charles Library. We recognize that this poses significant inconvenience for summer session enrollees and for faculty and graduate students pursuing research projects over the summer months.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Where can I get books during this time?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We continue to support borrowing of materials from Ambler, HSL, and Kardon for Temple University students, faculty, and staff. We are also offering the following to reduce the impact on the Temple academic community of closing Main Campus collections:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Inter-library loans: we continue to provide inter-library lending access (with 2-3 day delivery times) through <a href=\"https://ezb.relaisd2d.com/?LS=TEMPLE\">E-ZBorrow</a> and other systems to get materials delivered from other libraries;</li>\r\n<li>The University of Pennsylvania: between May 15 and August 29, Temple University students, faculty, and staff will have walk-in borrowing privileges for all circulating materials at the <a href=\"https://www.library.upenn.edu/vanpelt\">University of Pennsylvania’s Van Pelt Library</a>. Patrons must present their Temple ID and log into their E-ZBorrow account to demonstrate good standing. Our patrons will be able to borrow up to 20 items at a time for four weeks, and they can renew twelve times. Those patrons will also be granted computer access at Van Pelt and should inquire about this at the circulation desk;</li>\r\n<li>Library reserves for physical books in summer courses: we encouraged faculty teaching summer session courses to identify books and other materials that may be relevant to their subjects and to place them on <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/services/course-reserves\">reserve</a> at the Tuttleman Library Services Desk, which will remain operational and accessible through the month of July; and</li>\r\n<li>E-book alternatives: we encourage the use of e-book alternatives where those exist in our collections, in full recognition that for many academic uses physical books continue to be preferred by many of our users.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Can I return books after May 9?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes, you can return books to the Tuttleman Library Services Desk or the drop bins located outside of Tuttleman and just inside the Paley Bell Tower entrance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Can I renew books while Paley is closed?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Yes, you can renew books online or at the Tuttleman Library Services Desk.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Will there be any changes in alumni or guest borrowing privileges?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We will ceased accepting new courtesy borrower applications of all kinds effective April 15. This service will resume when we are in Charles Library. Alumni and guests who already have borrowing privileges will be able to borrow materials from Kardon and Ambler during the move.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How do I return books after May 9?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We will have return bins in the Tuttleman lobby. Patrons will also be able to return items at the circulation desk in Tuttleman.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why is access to the collections closed during the move?</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is an unusually complex move, largely because of the need to load approximately 1.5 million volumes into the Charles Library Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) while also relocating roughly 175,000 items to a traditional browsing stacks collection on the top floor of the new facility. During this time, it will be difficult to locate specific titles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Where can I study over the summer?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The closure will impact summer session students requiring access to study space. We are creating temporary study carrel and table seating areas in Tuttleman during the summer months. Students are also advised to use the <a href=\"https://its.temple.edu/lab/tech-center\">TECH Center</a> for printing, copying, and study needs.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/hsl\">Ginsburg Health Sciences Library</a> and the <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/about/locations/amblerlibrary\">Ambler Campus Library</a> will remain open for normal operations through the summer months and those facilities may also be used for study by all members of the Temple community.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How will access to the Special Collections Research Center be impacted?</strong></p>\r\n<p>For the duration of the move to Charles Library, the Special Collections Research Center’s collections will be largely inaccessible to all users. We will respond to requests for information about and from the collections as time and access permits but may defer in-depth response until resuming regular operations at the start of the fall semester. Please see the <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/scrc/libraryupdate\">Special Collections Research Center’s website</a> for more detailed information.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Are digital collections impacted by the move?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Access to digital collections (e-journals, e-books, streaming media, digitized Special Collections items) will be unimpeded by the close of physical collection access, so users who make online resources their primary path to library content will not be directly affected by the move process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How will guest computing access be impacted?</strong></p>\r\n<div>The Community Computer Program will close operations starting Monday August 12th. Our hope is to reopen that program on Sunday, August 25th. </div>\r\n<p><strong>How will alumni computing access be impacted?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Alumni computer use, which is processed differently than guest computer use, will unfortunately not be possible to support now that Paley has closed. We plan to resume alumni computer use when we are in Charles Library.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the plans for Paley Library?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Once all collections have been moved to Charles Library, Temple will continue to celebrate the generosity of the Samuel Paley Foundation and the Paley family by renaming the former library building \"Samuel Paley Hall.\" The building will be the new home for the College of Public Health and will continue to house the Center for Academic Advising and Professional Development for the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Science and Technology.</p>\r\n<p><strong>I’m a graduate student interested in a carrel in Charles Library. What can I expect?</strong></p>\r\n<p>We will have graduate lockers in Charles Library in lieu of the study carrels we had in Paley Library. We will be accepting reservations for these lockers when Charles Library opens.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Will the Center for Academic Advising and Professional Development be open?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Center for Academic Advising and Professional Development, which serves students in the <a href=\"https://cst.temple.edu/students/undergraduate-academic-advising\">College of Science and Technology</a> and the <a href=\"https://liberalarts.temple.edu/advising\">College of Liberal Arts</a>, will remain open throughout the move. Students will be able to access the center through the Bell Tower entrance to Paley Library.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What hours will Charles Library be open?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The hours have not yet been determined, but you can anticipate that opening and closing hours will be roughly similar (with the exception of the 24/7 space for Temple students, faculty, and staff).</p>\r\n<p><strong>What if I need research help?</strong></p>\r\n<p>For the duration of the move to Charles Library, Temple University Libraries will offer all of its regular <a href=\"https://library.temple.edu/asktulibraries\">research support services</a> to all members of the TU community. While the Ask Here Desk in Paley Library will close to the public, the services can be accessed via our virtual online chat service, email and text request, on-demand personal service at the Tuttleman Library Services Desk and by appointment. During this period we strongly recommend making an appointment to meet with a subject specialist librarian for a research consultation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Looking forward</strong></p>\r\n<p>Though many in our community will experience some degree of inconvenience during the library move process, we are optimistic that the positive impact of the new Charles Library on our academic environment will be worth the temporary disruptions involved in the move. Thank you for your time and understanding at this unique moment.</p>\r\n<h2>For more information</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Move and Paley closure:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Richie Holland, Director of Library Administration, 215-204-3455, <a href=\"mailto:richieh@temple.edu\">richieh@temple.edu</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Collections, borrowing, and guest computers:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Justin Hill, Department Head, Access and Media Services, 215-204-0750, <a href=\"mailto:jhill@temple.edu\">jhill@temple.edu</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Research or reference help:</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:asktulibrary@temple.edu\">asktulibrary@temple.edu</a></p>\r\n<p><strong>Special Collections Research Center:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Margery Sly, Director of Special Collections Research Center, 215-204-5201, <a href=\"mailto:msly@temple.edu\">msly@temple.edu</a></p>\r\n<p>Check back regularly for updates, as our move plan continues to evolve.</p>",

An image of the portrait can be found at the end of this sermon. The Samaritan Hospital referred to in the text is now the Temple University Hospital.

The Wiatt Mite Society house referred to in the text was replaced by a new University building some time ago.</p>\r\n<h2>\"THE HISTORY OF FIFTY-SEVEN CENTS\"</h2>\r\n<h3>Sermon By Russell H. Conwell</h3>\r\n<h3>Sunday Morning, December 1, 1912.</h3>\r\n<p>We are here to unveil this picture of Hattie May Wiatt, a little girl who died in 1886. Years have gone rapidly by, but she still speaks. We intend to put this picture in the pastor's study, in the most prominent place, and keep it there through the years to come, that people as they pass through may ask: \"What meaneth that picture?\" And the story, simple and wonderful, may be told.</p>\r\n<p>Little Hattie May Wiatt lived in a house near the church in which we then worshipped, at Berks and Mervine, which is now occupied by the Christian Church. It was a small church and was crowded, tickets of admission were obtained sometimes weeks in advance for every service. The Sunday school was as crowded as the rest of the congregation, and one day when I came down to the church, to attend Sabbath school, I found a number of children outside. They were greatly disturbed because they could not get in, on account of the crowd of children already in the Sunday school rooms of the church, and little Hattie May Wiatt, who lived near by, had brought her books and a contribution, and was standing by the gate, hesitating whether to go back home or wait and try to get in later. I took her up in my arms, lifted her to my shoulder, and then as she held on to my head - an embrace I never can forget - I carried her through the crowd in the hall, into the Sunday school room, and seated her in a chair away back in a dark corner. The next morning as I came down to the church from my home I came by their house and she was going up the street to school. As we met, I said: \"Hattie, we are going to have a larger Sunday school room soon\", and she said: \"I hope you will. It is so crowded that I am afraid to go there alone\". \"Well\", I replied, \"When we get the money with which to erect a school building we are going to construct one large enough to get all the little children in, and we are going to begin very soon to raise the money for it\". It was only in my mind as a kind of imaginary vision, but I wished to make conversation with the child. The next that I heard about it was that Hattie was very sick, and they asked me to come in and see the child, which I did, and prayed with her. I walked up the street, praying for the little girl's recovery, and yet all the time with the conviction that it was not to be.</p>\r\n<p>Hattie May Wiatt died. She had gathered 57 cents - some have written 54 - which was left as her contribution towards securing another building for the children. After the funeral the mother handed me the little bag with the gathered 57 cents. I took it to the church and stated that we had the first gift toward the new Sunday school building; that little Hattie May Wiatt, who had gone on into the Shining World, had left behind her this gift towards it. I then changed all the money into pennies and offered them for sale. I received about $250 for the 57 pennies; and 54 of those cents were returned to me by the people who bought them. I then had them put in a frame where they could be seen and exhibited them, and we received by a sale of the $250 changed into pennies money enough to buy the next house north of the church at Berks and Mervine. That house was bought by the Wiatt Mite Society, which was organized for the purpose of taking the 57 cents and enlarging on them sufficiently to buy the property for the Primary Department of the Sunday school. In the Wiatt Mite Society was Mr. Edward O. Elliott ( now one of our trustees) who has charge of this picture, and was then a member.</p>\r\n<p>Then when the crowd became so great we could no longer get in there, the thought impressed itself upon our congregation, \"We ought to have a larger church and a larger Sunday school room\". Faith in God was the characteristic of this people, and they said, \"We can do it\", notwithstanding the fact that the church had a mortgage on it then, I think, of $30,000, and that we had no money in advance. Yet the conviction was strong that we ought to build a larger church, and some ventured so far, though then it seemed absurd, to say that we might \"build on Broad Street somewhere\". But the Wiatt Mite Society, using the influence of Hattie May Wiatt's first deposit, raised the money to pay, as I said, for the house, and then the undertaking was before us, whether we would go out and try to build a large church. I walked over to see Mr. Baird, who lived on the corner where the German Athletic Association now has its meetings, and asked him what he wanted for this lot on which the Temple now stands.</p>\r\n<p>He said that he wanted $30,000. I told him that we had only 54 cents toward the $30,000, but that we were foolish enough to think that some time we would yet own that lot. Encouraged by what he said, and with no opposition on the part of the Board of Deacons, I went around again to talk with him, and asked him if he would not hold the lot for five years. Mr. Baird said: \"I have been thinking this matter over and have made up my mind I will sell you that lot for $25,000, taking $5,000 less than I think it is worth, and I will take the 54 cents as the first payment and you may give me a mortgage for the rest at 5%. I went back and so reported to the church, and they said: \"Well, we can raise more money that 54 cents\", but I went over and left the 54 cents with Mr. Baird and took a receipt for it as a part payment on the lot. Mr. Baird afterwards returned the 54 cents as another gift. Thus we bought the lot, and thus encouraged of God step by step, we went on constructing this building. We owed $109,000 when it was done, but we had courage and faith in God then. We could hardly have dreamed then that in the number of years that followed this people, without wealth, each giving only as he could afford from his earnings, could have paid off so great a debt without any outside help. The only outside help that we really received was from Mr. Bucknell. Although our church was then called the Grace Baptist Church, he was not willing that we should call the new building a church until the mortgage was paid. He gave us $10,000 on the condition that we call this building by some other name than the Grace Baptist Church, and that accounts for its being called The Temple instead of the Grace Church. Afterwards, when we did pay off the mortgage accounts, we dedicated the building and have a right now to call it whatever we choose, but after 21 years of being named as it is, there is no reason why we should change it, and there is no hope of doing so if we should undertake it. It will always be known as The Temple. I must state here also that in the house purchased by the sale of the 57 cents was organized The Temple University.</p>\r\n<p>Now, giving simply that brief introduction to the history of Hattie May Wiatt, I wish to call your attention to two or three important lessons in connection with it:</p>\r\n<p>Who are the really great of this world? Who are the mighty? Is it the king, the emperor, the president, the famous, estimated by the kingdom of heaven and on the books of God? How little we know. Our nation has given credit to Washington, to Jefferson, to Lafayette,t o the great Pitt of England, to the great generals and writers, and to great financiers like Morris, but there is one person hardly over mentioned in our history who had so much influence in our affairs that as a nation we ought to have her picture in every public hall and in every school; yet because she was a young woman she seems to have been lost to the sight of the world. That was the Princess Elizabeth, sister of Louis XVI, of France. That little woman who was a treasure of feminine loveliness, with a heart as pure and bright as any that ever beat in the breast of woman; she who lived in the aristocracy of that time, but who plead for the starving, common people and protested again against Marie Antoinette's use of the public money as she did at Versailles, and spent her life in charity and loving kindness. She laid the foundation for the victory of this nation. Those who read history know that we could not have hoped for freedom if Rochambeau had not come to this country, if the French had not indorsed us, and if the French had not fought England on the waters and lands of Europe while we were trying to fight our battles here. If it had not been for Yorktown and its surrender we could never have hoped to obtain our freedom from what was then the tyrannous king of England. Who sent Rochambeau, who used the influence that brought his coming about? In some of the correspndence of Benjamin Franklin, who represented us at the Court of France, we find that the princess, a lovely young woman, was well acquainted with him and liked to talk with him upon philosophy and upon American ideas. She served as a \"go-between\" with Franklin and the queen, who used her influence with the king; for Louis XVI reminds one of Henry Ward Beecher's statement with reference to his church in Ohio, when he said: \"It had only 19 members, 18 were women and the other one was nothing\". Louis XVI was really nothing, and Marie Antoinette was the power indeed behind the throne, and behind Marie Antoinette was the Princess Elizabeth. It was she who opened the way for Franklin to reach the ear of the king. It was she who went to the Prime Minister of France and secured from him the condemnation of the arms, which were sold for a few cents apiece to America, yet were just as good as the best made in the world. It was she who secured the influence of the king to declare war on England in order that he might help America to her liberty. It was that young woman, acting all the time with continued energy, with prayer as well as with her social influence as one of the royal family, who really secured to us our liberty. Yet how little is said of her. In the great records of the history of mankind she should occupy a leading place. When I think of that innocent, sweet woman going to the guillotine on that morning in the old cart, encouraging all the humbler ones in the cart with her to keep up t heir courage, to hold their faith in God and to believe in a future world; when I see that noble, patriotic martyr going to that great square where she was beheaded, I see one of the great martyrs of earth. Yet in history, I say, we find our nation remarkably silent concerning her. And so in the history of Hattie May Wiatt - the name is new to some of you. She was a school girl, living in one of the homes of the industrious, honorable, upright and saving classes of society, not of the wealthy and great, yet think how her life was used; think what God did with her and the great, yet think how her life was used; thaink what God did with her and the 54 cents that was used of hers. A glance at it would put many to shame. Think of this large church; think of the membership added to it - over 5600 - since that time. Think of the influence of its membership going out and spreading over the world. Think of the influence of the Sabbath school carried on in this great building for more than twenty years. Then think of the institutions this church founded. Think of the Samaritan Hospital and the thousands of sick people that have been cured there, and the thousands of poor that are ministered to every year. I received the report of the Samaritan Hospital for October last Saturday and find that during the month 2540 had visited the dispensary. By multiplying that by twelve to get the average for a year, we find that over 30,000 people every year go to the dispensary of that one hospital, and that does not include the inner wards for the poor or the private rooms. Then there is the other hopital, the Garretson, also taken up by the poeple of this church. Without this church, it could never have been started. There they ministered in one single year to over 14,000 workmen, wounded and broken and dying. When we think, I say, of the ministrations of these hospitals that were started by the influence of this church and supported in the .... in the beginning by members of this church, what a long roll it is of the deeds of Christian kindness. Think of how in that Wiatt house were begun the very first classes of the Temple College. The Wiatt Mite Society provided the seats, the books and the teachers. Thus it began as an evening school, and it has gone on growing and developing through the years. That house, bought for 54 cents in the first place, was sold and the proceeds given to the Temple College in order that it might open on Park avenue, and when we moved out of the original church that was given bodily to the Temple College, and the college sold it to the Christian Church and used the money to erect a building next door to us on Broad Street. Think of the influence of that 57 cents just for a moment. Almost 80,000 young people have gone through the classes of the Temple University, and think where they are. A year ago we estimated that there were 500 young men and women in the business department who earned nothing before they went there and who, after six months' instruction, were earning from $5 to $15 a week. Think of the added income, of the added comforts, which even the smallest departments had given, and then think of the Departments of Law, Medicine, Dentistry, Theology, Household Arts, the Normal School and the Teachers' College - nearly 4000 are now going in and out its various doors in various parts of the city. Just estimate how they will go and teach thousands more, and how those thousands will in turn teach many thousands more in their lifetime; think how it sweeps the world in a century with one teacher, multiplying himself or herself a hundred times, perhaps, nearly every year. Two years ago - the smallest year of that work, - we took statistics of the Temple University students to learn their religious connection, and, of course, we found all kinds of religions because it is an undenominational institution. We ascertained that 504 young men of all denominations were studying for the Gospel ministry, in a single year. Now, if we graduate - and certainly we do - at least a hundred a year into the ministry of the various denominations, think what must have come to pass in twenty years. Think of it - two thousand people preaching the Gospel because Hattie May Wiatt invested her 54 cents; because she laid the foundations and gave her life for it.</p>\r\n<p>I wish I had time to extend these remarks until you could realize more than one can without details. But I want to draw one or two more lessons and at once. In the first place, the people had faith in God, and they went ahead, trusting Him, and He has followed all the way. He has kept and protected us through every step with great care, and the future is just as safe, certainly, as is the past. Hattie May Wiatt was being used to do a mighty work. We sometimes think that when a life stops in eight years, or in ten, it is a shortened life, and that it is a broken life, that it was never completed. But in God's sight, every life is complete. Whether taken at eight, ten, twenty, thirty, fifty, or seventy years, every life is complete, when God takes it; hence, that is the case with the life of Hattie May Wiatt. Think of the sorrow that was in that home. I shall never forget the broken-hearted state of the family and friends who came to the funeral. Think of that mother sorrowing through all these years. I am making her heart more tender every moment as I speak, I am arousing within her the memory of those days which a mother can never forget. But Hattie died at the right time, she was called of God at exactly the moment when it was best for earth and for the kingdom to come that she should go. Her life was filled out, it was complete, and when we think of the influence of it upon the world, upon all the ages, we feel as though she was one of the greatest of earth who had accomplished that which leaders of armies had failed to do, and that which kings upon their thrones could not accomplish. Her life was just as long as any other.</p>\r\n<p>The other thought that I would have dwelled upon if I had the time, is that being dead she yet speaks. Men may have powers of eloquence, they may sing with all the sweetness of angelic voices, and yet they may not speak as Hattie May Wiatt speaks tonight, as she will speak through your life as you go out and do differently from what you would have done if you had not been here. Hattie May Wiatt is speaking in tones of eloquence, sweet, divine and powerful, moving on upon the ages. Many men are counted great, many men are given credit for that which they do not do, but here is a life filled with motive power that sweeps on for all time. Twenty years and more have gone, and is she twenty years older in Heaven? When her mother meets her there will she be twenty years older than she was when she went?</p>\r\n<p>When that little lad brought five loaves and two small fishes to be used of Christ for His great work of feeding the five thousand, it was precisely the same thing that Hattie May Wiatt did when she brought her 57 cents, and that lad and Hattie May Wiatt are now in the land on high. Does she see us? Yes, she does. It is one of the great comforts of life that every person is used of God, that every individual is loved just as closely and in careful detail as though he were the only person on this earth. Think of that, my brother, my sister, if there were not another person living on earth God could not take any more individual care of you than He now does. He sees and knows you; though you may think your life is humble, unknown, hidden, yet God sees all, and your life has probably just as great an influence for the uplift of mankind and the progress of His kingdom as has been the life of those who are seemingly great, seemingly famous in this world. There is no difference before God. The humblest of His Christian servants is doing just as much for His kingdom, when waiting, or doing faithfully their little duty, as are the seemingly great; and Hattie May Wiatt looks down from the towers of Heaven upon this world and sees all these myriads of powerful influences moving out upon the earth and shaping the course of the world beyond anything we can dream. She is happy on high with the thought that her life was so full, that it was so complete, that she lived really to be so old in the influences she threw upon this earth.</p>\r\n<p>********</p>\r\n<p>Retyped from the publication of the sermon in The Temple Review, the weekly magazine of the Baptist Temple, v.21, no.7, December 19, 1912.
