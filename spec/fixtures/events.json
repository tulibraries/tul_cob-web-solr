        "description": "<p>Join us at the Blockson Collection to celebrate the launch of Philadelphia Legacies Week, an annual event honoring people who have made important contributions to Philadelphia. We will also unveil portraits for this year’s award winners: journalists Trudy Haynes and Acel Moore.</p>\n<p><strong>Trudy Haynes</strong> was one of the country’s first female reporters, the first Black female TV reporter and the first African American TV weather reporter. She started reporting in 1963 in Detroit, but made her name in Philadelphia starting in 1965 as a reporter for KYW-3. In her prime, she interviewed tons of celebrities, including a few Presidents and even Dr. Martin Luther King (twice). She has a long esteemed history, many high profile interviews and awards, including two Lifetime Achievement Awards and an Emmy.</p>\n<p><strong>Acel Moore</strong> began his career with the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> as a copy clerk in 1962. In 1964, he became an editorial clerk, and from 1968 to 1981, he worked as a staff writer. In 1974, Moore and Reggie Bryant hosted a television show called <em>Black Perspectives on the News</em> on Philadelphia’s WHYY public television. In 1977, Moore won the Pulitzer Prize for local investigative reporting for his series on abuse of inmates at Fairview State Hospital. From 1980 to 1989, Moore served on the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley and administered the school’s summer program for minority journalists; he was also a journalism instructor at Temple University and Florida A&amp;M University as well as journalism consultant to several universities.</p>\n<p>Register at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/launch-of-philadelphia-legacies-week-and-4th-annual-portrait-awards-tickets-71511293203\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/launch-of-philadelphia-legacies-week-and-4th-annual-portrait-awards-tickets-71511293203</a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

As a result of this article, he was invited to chair the National Park Service Underground Railroad Advisory Committee. Mr. Blockson has written four books about the Underground Railroad. He also inherited 39 personal items of Harriet Tubman from her great-niece Merlie Wilkens, which he donated to the National African American Museum of History and Culture inWashington, DC. </p>\n<p>As part of this program, Mr. Blockson will also discuss untold stories of some of the freedom seekers connected to the Underground Railroad in Philadelphia including the Johnson House and Camp William Penn. He will also talk about William Still, Thomas Garrett, Lucretia Mott, Frederick Douglass, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and John Brown.  </p>\n<p><em>This program is in partnership with the Special Committee on 400 Years of African American History, 1619 to 2019, and the Mayor’s Commission on African and Caribbean Immigrant Affairs.</em></p>\n<p>\tPrograms offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

The exhibit was initially intended to make a stop at Temple University’s Ginsburg Health Sciences Library during September 2020. In light of the coronavirus pandemic traveling exhibits were paused.

While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data (including 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and HIPAA-compliant environments), it is specifically geared to support online or offline data capture for clinical research studies and operations. Will Dean, Research and Data Services Librarian at the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, will show you how to create a more complicated and collaborative REDCap Project. We will go over using branching logic to hide and show fields, add collaborators and control what data they can access (user rights, roles and data access groups), create longitudinal research study events in your project, schedule surveys for particular times, and import data.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that you register for this workshop ahead of time so a REDCap account can be created for you, if you do not already have one.</p>\n<p>This is part of a series of three workshops on REDCap.

In the MA in Urban Bioethics program, students were tasked with creating a Community Map using a customized Google Map. Teams worked alongside a community advisor, observing, assessing, and analyzing each community’s strengths, resources, assets, and challenges with particular emphasis on healthcare and the social determinants of health. Each group created a map of their community site while examining their site in a larger context. A map alone cannot draw conclusions for students; however, through a combination of critical thinking, collaboration, and discussion, students can use this visual tool to draw conclusions in a unique space.</p>\n<p>\t<a href=\"https://ginsburgstudy.temple.edu/calendar/events/mappingSP20\">https://ginsburgstudy.temple.edu/calendar/events/mappingSP20</a></p>",

Today’s step is: Plan!</p>\n<p>Data Management Plans (DMPs) are a simple, easy tool to lay out the methods and procedures for collecting, storing and preserving your research data. Not only are they useful in organizing your work, most funders now require you to create one when applying for a research grant. Learn the basics of DMPs, tools to create them, and how Temple University Libraries can support your research. </p>\n<p>This workshop will be offered as an online session via Zoom. You must register for this workshop. You will receive a registration confirmation email, which includes the Zoom link for the workshop. On the day of the workshop, participants should log into their temple.zoom.us accounts in order to skip the waiting room. If participants are not Temple affiliates, they should use their first and last names in order to be admitted to the session. Participants do not need a video camera or a microphone, but will need an audio connection to hear the instructor.</p>\n<p>Please contact Will Dean, <a href=\"mailto:william.dean@temple.edu\">william.dean@temple.edu</a> with any questions.<br>\n\t </p>",

In this workshop, participants will learn how to create interactive, generative creative works using the JavaScript programming language, and how to display them on the web. We will practice the fundamentals of computational thinking with the goal that the programming skills learned be transferrable to other web frameworks and languages. Detours through data visualization, interactivity, and the history of generative art and computer-based art will frame our exploration of programming as a creative medium. No prior programming experience is required. </p>\n<p>There will be six workshops in this series. You are not required to come to every one, but consistent attendance is encouraged.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/event/5814305\">https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/event/5814305</a></p>\n<p>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

        "description": "<p>Welcome to Love Data Week, an annual celebration of all things data! This year, we offer workshops based on each step in the data lifecycle. Today’s step is: Analyze!<br>\n\t <br>\n\tRemember when your teacher told you to ‘show your work’? Jupyter Notebooks is a platform that allows users to test and demonstrate their data analysis and visualizations by showing all the steps taken and letting others reproduce them. Jupyter is also a good platform for learning coding languages like Python and R that are commonly used to analyze and visualize data. Alex Wermer-Colan of the Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Center will provide an introduction to using Jupyter Notebooks with Google Colab. No coding experience is required.</p>\n<p>This workshop will be offered as an online session via Zoom. You must register for this workshop. You will receive a registration confirmation email, which includes the Zoom link for the workshop. On the day of the workshop, participants should log into their temple.zoom.us accounts in order to skip the waiting room. If participants are not Temple affiliates, they should use their first and last names in order to be admitted to the session. Participants do not need a video camera or a microphone, but will need an audio connection to hear the instructor.</p>\n<p>Please contact Will Dean, <a href=\"mailto:william.dean@temple.edu\">william.dean@temple.edu</a> with any questions.<br>\n\t </p>",

Students will learn how to navigate the command line, code in Python, use an integrated development environment, and adapt readymade scripts for text editing, webscraping, and data analytics (including such packages as NLTK, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas). This workshop series will focus on learning how to teach yourself computational skills, to troubleshoot errors, and to learn the basics of a programming language in order to adapt scripts for a wide range of purposes. Students will be introduced to beginner-intermediate level syntax and logic of Python, as well as developing a framework for distinguishing when Python is useful, and when other programming languages are necessary.</p>\n<p>There will be seven workshops in this series.

        "description": "<p><em>Temple University Libraries and the Teaching and Learning with Technology Roundtable Present</em>: Historically speaking, maps have been knowledge claims about society and space, and as such cartographic practice has been wrought with representational power. More critical versions of cartographic pedagogy have more recently emphasized using the map to allow students to reflect upon their own subject-position within that representational practice. Such a learning goal is also quite in line with student centered pedagogy. This presentation shows how digital storytelling techniques can be combined with Story Maps, an online mapping platform for non-specialists, to accomplish that goal while creating an effective multi-media spatial narrative. It also profiles student work using these technologies from a spring 2016 section of Digital Mapping.</p>\n<p>This program is part of the Libraries' <em>Beyond the Page</em> public programming series.</p>",

        "description": "<p>In The Audacity of Hoop (Temple University Press, 2015), best-selling author Alexander Wolff explores Barack Obama, person and president, through the game of basketball. Join us as Wolff discusses this rich text, which includes more than 125 images that explore how America’s “first post-industrial sport” helped Obama introduce himself to voters, wage two successful presidential campaigns, and exercise the power of the office at home and abroad. Wolff has been writing for Sports Illustrated for more than thirty years. He has served as the president of the United States Basketball Writers Association, and has been honored by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In addition to The Audacity of Hoop, Wolff is the author or co-author of six other books about basketball.</p>",

This role, which enables everything from scathing reviews of artwork to wholesale digitization of books for accessibility, is taking on new currency as librarians scramble to preserve contested government information online. From deleted climate data, disappearing government web pages, and ephemeral political tweets, fair use cuts through the legal confusion so we can maintain the historical and scientific record. This webinar will introduce fair use as an equitable doctrine designed to support librarianship and prepare participants to apply fair use in their own communities’ work.</p>\n<p>\n\tLearning outcomes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand the fundamentals of fair use as an equitable doctrine that permits use of copyrighted materials for the public good.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Understand the copyright issues surrounding government information and the effects of sharing materials posted on different platforms such as .gov sites and social media platforms like Twitter.</li>\n</ul><ul>\n<li>Apply fair use in their own practice preserving and sharing digital government documents in their own communities.</li>\n</ul>",

This augmented reality mobile game takes players on a tour through historical protest activity on the Temple campus. </p>\n<p>As a reporter for The Temple News, you follow clues from your editor to campus locations where civil activism took place. The game walks you through time, beginning with the Vietnam era  through the recent #blacklivesmatter protests, and guides you to the precise campus location where the protests took place. Once there, you can view historic images and news footage from Temple University Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center. </p>\n<p>Please join us in the Digital Scholarship Center on Monday, April 18 at 11:00 AM to participate in a group play through of the game. Then, on Wednesday, April 20 at 11:00 AM, also in the Digital Scholarship Center, we will discuss the making of the game and solicit feedback from the audience.</p>\n<p>This game was built on the ARIS platform, which requires an iPhone to play.  If you don't have an iPhone, you can still join us—we will pair you with a partner to play the game. </p>\n<p>This program is part of the Beyond the Page public programming series.

        "description": "<p>This talk is presented by Miriam Solomon, PhD, Professor and Interim Chair, Philosophy Department at Temple University.</p>\r\n<p>Medical practice usually develops slowly, moving from basic research through three stages of clinical trials to guidelines, outcome evaluations, and revised guidelines. With COVID-19, researchers are being asked to speed up the process as much as possible in order to stem the pandemic. In the meantime, clinicians are working with interim guidelines, and often need to rely on their own clinical judgement to make treatment decisions. This talk will describe the challenges of such “fast medicine.” The current situation will be compared with the HIV epidemic, discussing Steve Epstein’s <em><a href=\"https://librarysearch.temple.edu/catalog/991036791475403811\">Impure Science</a> </em>(University of California Press, 1996) account of how ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) persuaded the scientific community to reconfigure clinical trials of antiviral treatments to address urgent needs. Epistemic humility—a nuanced understanding of our fallibility—is an attitude that is especially helpful in these circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom. Registration is encouraged. On the day of the program, use this link to join: <a href=\"https://temple.zoom.us/j/91971588235\">https://temple.zoom.us/j/91971588235</a></p>\r\n<p>This event is presented in conjunction with the Health Sciences Libraries online presentation of the <em>Politics of Yellow Fever in Alexander Hamilton’s America</em> exhibit sponsored by the National Library of Medicine. The exhibit was initially intended to make a stop at Temple University’s Ginsburg Health Sciences Library during September 2020. In light of the coronavirus pandemic traveling exhibits were paused.  The relevance of the topic to the current situation is clear and we decided to move ahead with a local virtual exhibit, workshops and speaker events.</p>\r\n<p>Please contact Courtney Eger, <a href=\"mailto:courtney.eger@temple.edu\">courtney.eger@temple.edu</a>, with any questions.</p>",

Some materials are more cost effective than others which can impact student engagement. Canvas invites new ways of thinking about how faculty can integrate a range of course materials as well as draw inspiration from existing learning objects. Join us to learn about tools you can use in Canvas -- such as open educational resources, library-licensed content, Ares course reserves, and the Canvas Commons -- to make it both easy and cost effective for your students to access the materials with which you most want them to engage.

While stigma and infectious disease in general are connected at a deep level that extends back from millennia, there is no question that specific forms of racism mark USian history from the beginning. Many scholars have pointed out how the racism that plagued Philadelphia in 1793 affected the devastating yellow fever epidemic of the time. This talk will explain the structural features of such racism and will extend the analysis to several other epidemics in USian history. The talk will conclude by linking the historical analysis to law and policy interventions that can reduce the stigma and racism currently shaping the COVID-19 pandemic in the US.</p>\r\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom. Registration is encouraged.

The exhibit initially intended to make a stop at Temple University’s Ginsburg Health Sciences Library during September 2020. In light of the coronavirus pandemic traveling exhibits were paused.

In this workshop, participants will learn how to create interactive, generative creative works using the JavaScript programming language, and how to display them on the web. We will practice the fundamentals of computational thinking with the goal that the programming skills learned be transferrable to other web frameworks and languages. Detours through data visualization, interactivity, and the history of generative art and computer-based art will frame our exploration of programming as a creative medium. No prior programming experience is required. </p>\n<p>There will be six workshops in this series.

She then focuses on his five years working on an Alabama plantation and his role as a founder of Alabama’s historic Africatown, where he lived out his post-Emancipation life.

This workshop series will focus on learning how to teach yourself computational skills, to troubleshoot errors, and to learn the basics of a programming language in order to adapt scripts for a wide range of purposes. Students will be introduced to beginner-intermediate level syntax and logic of Python, as well as developing a framework for distinguishing when Python is useful, and when other programming languages are necessary.</p>\n<p>There will be seven workshops in this series.

Precious Places teaches the video production process to participating groups, fostering projects authored by those who intimately know the featured neighborhoods.</p>\n\n<p>Conceived as a way to allow neighborhood groups to celebrate their unique histories and as a tool to address current concerns, the Precious Places video documentaries explore the rich stories of our communities and the memories held in public spaces and community landmarks. They record community histories and help define where we live at a time when so many of the city's memories are undergoing so much change.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis program is part of the Black Lives Always Mattered! public program series at the Blockson Collection, which is made possible through the support of the PEW Center for Arts &amp; Heritage grant.</p>\n<p><em>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

On the day of the workshop, participants should log into their temple.zoom.us accounts in order to skip the waiting room. If participants are not Temple affiliates, they should use their first and last names in order to be admitted to the session. Participants do not need a video camera or a microphone, but will need an audio connection to hear the instructor.</p>\n\n<p>This workshop focuses on building intermediate REDCap skills. While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data (including 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and HIPAA-compliant environments), it is specifically geared to support online or offline data capture for clinical research studies and operations. You will learn how to create a more complicated and collaborative REDCap Project. We will go over using branching logic to hide and show fields, add collaborators and control what data they can access (user rights, roles and data access groups), create longitudinal research study events in your project, schedule surveys for particular times, and import data.</p>\n\n<p>When you register for this workshop, a REDCap account will be created for you, if you do not already have one.</p>\n\n<p>Please contact Will Dean, the Research and Data Services Librarian at the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, <a href=\"mailto:will.dean@temple.edu\">will.dean@temple.edu</a>, with any questions.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This workshop is part of a series of three workshops on REDCap.

        "description": "<p>Did you know that since 1978, the cost of textbooks has increased 810% or 3x the inflation rate? Nationally, students are told to budget $1,200-$1,300 a year for books. That’s a lot of money! One way faculty can make their courses more affordable for students is by assigning an open textbook. Open textbooks are digital books that are free to read, download, and print. In this workshop, we’ll provide an introduction to the world of open educational resources. We’ll discuss how to find high quality open textbooks in your discipline, and show you how these books can be customized to suit the needs of your particular class. In addition, Thomas Wright, Assistant Professor of Instruction and Public Speaking Course Director will share his experience reviewing a book for the Open Textbook Library and his plans to adopt an OER textbook for his course.</p>\n<p>Special bonus: The first 10 instructors who register for this workshop and write a brief review of an open textbook that is accepted for publication by the Open Textbook Library will receive a $200 stipend.</p>\n<p>\n\tRegister at: <a href=\"https://paleystudy.temple.edu/event/4485608\">https://paleystudy.temple.edu/event/4485608</a></p>",

They range from the first black woman known to be born in Philadelphia (1694)—who ran a ferry business during colonial times—to the woman whose childhood experiences led her to become a surgeon and medical advisor to celebrities. All of the women “bring it” as activists— in community and movement work, business and civic institutions, education, faith, medicine, law and government, journalism, sports, and the arts. And they have had larger-than-life impact on the city, the country and the world.</p>\n<p>The words of the book’s contemporary women are memorable. One woman observed that if the authors “had not written this book it wouldn’t have been done.” Another said, “This is who black women are. Not just me, but black women.” The authors’ experiences as activists, researchers and educators—and of frequently being the “only black women in the room”— fills the book not just with facts, but with genuine empathy.</p>\n<p>These are the stories of the black women in one of the country’s most important cities, and who let no obstacle deter them from changing the game.</p>\n<p><em>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

        "description": "<p>If you’re pretty savvy with REDCap (or have taken the previous two REDCap workshops in this series), it’s time for a dive into the advanced features of REDCap. You may be familiar with using REDCap to collect survey data for your research, but this versatile service also has many interesting and helpful features that can streamline your methods and open up new avenues for data collection. We will cover: using the calendar tool to track your project, repeatable survey instruments, sending surveys via text (both sending a survey link and sending survey questions themselves), using calculated fields, and data exports.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>When you register for this workshop, a REDCap account will be created for you, if you do not already have one. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Learn more about REDCap at these workshops:<br><a href=\"https://ginsburgstudy.temple.edu/event/7297144\">REDCap Introduction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ginsburgstudy.temple.edu/event/7297170\">REDCap Intermediate</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ginsburgstudy.temple.edu/event/7298480\">REDCap vs. Qualtrics</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This workshop will be offered as an online session via Zoom.

        "description": "<p>Join us for conversation between Oliver St. Clair Franklin OBE, Honorary Consul, British Honorary Consulate, Philadelphia and Sudhir Hazareesingh, author of Black Spartacus: The Epic Life of Toussaint Louverture.</p>\n\n<p>Toussaint Louverture, formerly enslaved, rose to become the leader of the only successful slave revolt in modern history—known as the Haitian Revolution. Employing groundbreaking archival research and a keen interpretive lens, Sudhir Hazareesingh restores Toussaint to his full complexity in Black Spartacus. </p>\n\n<p>At a time when his subject has, variously, been reduced to little more than a one-dimensional icon of liberation or criticized for his personal failings—his white mistresses, his early ownership of slaves, his authoritarianism —Hazareesingh proposes a new conception of Toussaint’s understanding of himself and his role in the Atlantic world of the late eighteenth century. </p>\n\n<p>Black Spartacus is a work of both biography and intellectual history, rich with insights into Toussaint’s fundamental hybridity—his ability to unite European, African, and Caribbean traditions in the service of his revolutionary aims. Hazareesingh offers a new and resonant interpretation of Toussaint’s racial politics, showing how he used Enlightenment ideas to argue for the equal dignity of all human beings while simultaneously insisting on his own world-historical importance and the universal pertinence of blackness—a message which chimed particularly powerfully among African Americans.</p>\n\n<p>Black Spartacus offers a vigorous argument for “getting back to Toussaint”—a call to take Haiti’s founding father seriously on his own terms, and to honor his role in shaping the postcolonial world to come.</p>\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom: <a href=\"https://temple.zoom.us/j/93508763058\" target=\"_blank\">https://temple.zoom.us/j/93508763058</a>. </p>\n<p>Programs are free and open to all, and registration is encouraged. </p>\n<p>Contact <a href=\"mailto:lwillis@temple.edu\">lwillis@temple.edu</a> with questions.</p>",

This month, we focus on finding 3D models! The easiest and most expeditious method of 3D printing relies on finding pre-existing 3D models that either suit your needs or can be edited to meet your requirements. This workshop focuses on where to find 3D models for 3D printing, how to differentiate between 3D model formats, how to test 3D models to make sure they are intact and of satisfactory quality, and how to edit 3D models in various ways using Meshmixer.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrograms offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

The Eastwick Neighborhood in Southwest Philadelphia is no different. Located in the heart of a number of environmental hazards, the Eastwick community is extremely vulnerable to the oncoming effects of climate change. In 2017, The Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority sought to address these mounting risks with the Lower Eastwick Public Land Strategy. This plan is taking an innovative approach to urban revitalization through resilience planning efforts.</p>\n<p>Led by Community Development Professor and City Planner Martine Decamp, this discussion will explore the progress of the project so far and why community engagement in urban revitalization is a core part of resilience. Panelists include Terry Williams, Zakia Elliot, and Earl Wilson.</p>",

How do we design impactful stories that also allow a high degree of freedom on the part of the viewer? Augmented reality allows physical surfaces and graphic images to trigger digital content “auras” (videos, images, links) when viewed through a smart device. What potential does this hold for storytelling? What stories are evoked by physical spaces—secrets revealed, ghosts uncovered, hidden truths brought to light?</p>\n<p>This is the final screening event for Media Studies and Production courses 4741: Emergent Media Production and 8741: Cybermedia Workshop with Prof. Laura Zaylea, in an innovative collaboration with MSP 4446: Psychological Processing of Media with Dr. Matthew Lombard.

Their work explores a number of places that have almost disappeared―from workshops and factories to sporting clubs and societies, synagogues, churches, theaters, and railroad lines—and the neighborhoods connected to those places. In <em>Philadelphia: Finding the Hidden City</em>, published by Temple University Press, Popkin and Woodall uncover the contemporary essence of one of America’s oldest cities.</p>\n<p>Working with accomplished architectural photographer Joseph Elliott, the authors explore secret places in familiar locations, such as the Metropolitan Opera House on North Broad Street, the Divine Lorraine Hotel, Reading Railroad, Disston Saw Works in Tacony, and mysterious parts of City Hall. They connect Philadelphia’s idiosyncratic history, culture, and people to develop an alternative theory of American urbanism, and place the city in American urban history.</p>\n<p><strong>Nathaniel Popkin</strong> is co-founder of the web magazine <em>Hidden City Daily</em> and senior writer for the documentary film <em>Philadelphia: The Great Experiment</em>. He is the author of <em>Song of the City: An Intimate History of the American Urban Landscape</em> and <em>The Possible City: Exercises in Dreaming Philadelphia</em>, as well as the novel <em>Lion and Leopard</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Peter Woodall</strong> is a former newspaper reporter and producer for public radio. He co-founded the web magazine <em>Hidden City Daily</em> and is the project director of its parent organization, Hidden City Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>This program is part of the Libraries' <em>Beyond the Page</em> public programming series.</p>",

Community leaders Dr. Neil Pitts and Mr. Brandon Brown will have a conversation facilitated by Dr. Nora Jones, Associate Director of the Center for Urban Bioethics. We will begin with a discussion of some of the new challenges the pandemic has brought, from switching to online learning in communities without universal internet access to maintaining community support networks in light of the closing of local churches. Panelists will then connect contemporary challenges to historical context and discuss how a full understanding of COVID-19 -- now and moving forward -- requires attention to the issue of trust between the African American community and the medical establishment. The conversation will end with examples of the novel ways the North Philadelphia community has come together to creatively meet the challenges of COVID-19 and suggest trust-building opportunities for academic and medical institutions.</p>\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom.

The exhibit was initially intended to make a stop at Temple University’s Ginsburg Health Sciences Library during September 2020. In light of the coronavirus pandemic traveling exhibits were paused.

Wikimedia Foundation found that less than 10% of its contributors identify as female. While the reasons for the gender gap are debateable, the effect is not. Content is skewed by the lack of female participation, creating imbalance in this increasingly important repository of shared knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>HOW: Register online here: <a href=\"http://goo.gl/forms/0F23xmpvvM\">http://goo.gl/forms/0F23xmpvvM</a>. Arrive with your laptop or device, power cord, and ideas for entries. It’s that simple. We will provide tutorials for beginner Wikipedians, reference materials, and refreshments.</p>\r\n<p>Last year, 1,500 participants at more than 75 events around the world created nearly 400 new pages and improved 500 articles. Join us to broaden that reach in 2016!</p>\r\n<p>ACCESSIBILITY INFO: The UArts location is not fully accessible. Participants will need to be able to go up and down stairs. The Temple location is accessible by stairs or elevator with restrooms available on the same floor. Both locations require a photo ID to enter the building.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Trained as both a fine art photographer and as a geologist, Jonathon Wells has created scientifically accurate photo-geologic composites with both surface and subsurface views since 2002.  He continues to build the existing Location and Environmental series while initiating new series at sites around the world where he identifies a thought-provoking intersection of land use and underlying geology.</p>\n<p>Wells’ artistic process takes months of study and investigation. First he searches for both landscapes and geologic frameworks that intrigue him.</p>\n<p>He might spend days documenting a single city block. To visualize the substrata, Wells will turn to old and new geologic surveys and maps, to utility maps and geologic field guides.  He’ll pull off roadways to photograph rock exposures, follow road workers and underground cable repairs with his camera, waiting for an exposed opening — a “window” — that will allow him to capture a glimpse of what lies below us. Finally, he creates the photo-geologic composite digitally, combining a documented landscape with the substrata below.</p>\n<p>This program is part of the Libraries' <em>Beyond the Page</em> public programming series.</p>\n<p><em>This program is part of our </em>Seeing Stories: Visualizing Sustainable Citizenship<em> series, co-curated by Temple Contemporary, Temple University’s Office of Sustainability, and Temple University Libraries, along with faculty and graduate students from the Tyler School of Art, the College of Liberal Arts, and the Center for the Cinematic and Performing Arts.</em></p>",

She is a Visiting Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. In 2012, Washko founded The Council on Gender Sensitivity and Behavioral Awareness in World of Warcraft as an ongoing intervention on communal language formation inside the most popular massively multi-player online role playing game of all time. In an attempt at radical empathy, she recently interviewed the web's most infamous misogynist. A recent recipient of The Franklin Furnace Performance Fund Grant, a Creative Time Report commission, a Rhizome Internet Art Microgrant, a Danish International Visiting Artist Grant and the Terminal Award, Washko’s practice has been highlighted in Frieze Magazine, Time Magazine, The Guardian (UK), ArtForum, ARTnews, VICE, Hyperallergic, Rhizome, the New York Times, The Creator’s Project, Dazed and Confused Magazine, Digicult, ArtInfo, Bad At Sports and more. Her projects have been presented nationally and internationally at venues including Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art (Helsinki, Finland), Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, Moving Image Art Fair (London and NYC), the Rotterdam International Film Festival, Institute for Contemporary Art Boston and Foundation Vasarely (Aix-en-Provence, France).

How can we build a campus community that is truly welcoming? What does a welcoming campus look like? What resources are available on and off campus that can help us? How can we commit to making our campus welcoming in the midst of unpopular efforts to regulate immigration and when white supremacists, members of the far right and various other extremist figures have made a point of staging provocations on college campuses across the country, inviting political discord – and, in some cases, violence? Together we will share strategies, resources, and perspectives on these important questions.</p>\n<p><strong>Panelists:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tiffenia Archie, Assistant Vice President for the Office of Institutional Diversity, Equity, Advocacy and Leadership (IDEAL), Temple University</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Jennifer Lee, Assistant Clinical Professor of Law and Director of the Social Justice Lawyering Clinic at the Sheller Center for Social Justice, Temple University</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Pastor Adan Mairena, West Kensington Ministry</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Jessica Sandberg, Director of International Admissions, Temple University</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThis program takes place during the <a href=\"https://www.welcomingamerica.org/\">Welcoming America</a> organization’s <a href=\"https://www.welcomingamerica.org/programs/welcoming-week\">Welcoming Week</a>.

        "description": "<p>For ten years running, the Libraries and the Faculty Senate Committee on the Status of Faculty of Color have co-hosted this engaging series of panels on timely topics, featuring faculty from across the university. Our second <em>Chat in the Stacks</em> of the fall semester explores the Dakota Access Pipeline and its connection to climate change and environmental racism.</p>\n<p>The construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, which runs from North Dakota to Illinois, was opposed by Standing Rock Sioux tribe members and environmentalists on the grounds that it would threaten the region’s clean water and ancient burial grounds. Even as the the pipeline’s environmental impact is currently being assessed, courts have ruled that it can continue operating. Join us for a panel discussion about the importance of continuing to engage in conversations about the operation of this pipeline, its lasting effects on the nearby Native American community and the land, and the often uneven distribution of environmental harm.  </p>\n<p>Participants include <strong>Elizabeth Sweet </strong>and <strong>David Orgon</strong> from Geography and Urban Studies, <strong>Amy Sinden</strong> from the Law School, Anthropology graduate students <strong>Dana I. Muniz Pacheco</strong> and <strong>Keisha Weil</strong>, and organizer <strong>Kimmika Williams-Witherspoon</strong> from the Theater Department.</p>\n<p>This program is part of the Libraries' <em>Beyond the Page </em>public programming series.</p>",

Initially inspired by a New Yorker essay about the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, Antigone invites conversation around moral, religious, and political dilemmas regarding the unburied dead. Performed in both English and Classical Greek, the production will feature Mr. Terzopoulus’ physically  rigorous methodology. The thematic content of the play, the creative team’s preparations for it, and the very structure of Classical theater are governed by the cultural systems and rituals that shape everyday life and artistic convention. Join Temple University Libraries, the Intellectual Heritage Program, and the Wilma theater for a discussion and talkback with Terzopoulos and other members of Wilma’s creative team.</p>\n<p>Antigone runs at the Wilma Theater from October 7-November 8.

This augmented reality mobile game takes players on a tour through historical protest activity on the Temple campus. </p>\n<p>As a reporter for The Temple News, you follow clues from your editor to campus locations where civil activism took place. The game walks you through time, beginning with the Vietnam era  through the recent #blacklivesmatter protests, and guides you to the precise campus location where the protests took place. Once there, you can view historic images and news footage from Temple University Libraries’ Special Collections Research Center. </p>\n<p>Please join us in the Digital Scholarship Center on Monday, April 18 at 11:00 AM to participate in a group play through of the game. Then, on Wednesday, April 20 at 11:00 AM, also in the Digital Scholarship Center, we will discuss the making of the game and solicit feedback from the audience.</p>\n<p>This game was built on the ARIS platform, which requires an iPhone to play.  If you don't have an iPhone, you can still join us—we will pair you with a partner to play the game.</p>\n<p>This program is part of the Beyond the Page public programming series.

Participants will then be asked to practice applying current fair use law to a series of hypothetical fact patterns.</p>\n<p>Learning outcomes</p>\n<p>Learn the history of fair use factors and subfactors including commerciality, publication status, and transformativeness.

Greenfield Civic History Lecture. In this lecture, <a href=\"https://tyler.temple.edu/faculty/lynn-mandarano-phd\">Dr. Lynn Mandarano</a>, associate professor of planning and community development in the Department of Architecture and Environmental Design at Temple University’s Tyler School of Art and Architecture, will explore the role history can play in building community identity, capacity, and cohesion after decades of disinvestment and recent onset of gentrification. </p>\r\n<p>For more than seven years, Dr. Mandarano has been partnering with community organizations in Eastern North Philadelphia for the capstone service-learning course in the Community Development major as well as community-based research projects. Recent student work has focused on uncovering the history of iconic businesses and buildings along Germantown Avenue between Girard and Lehigh Avenues and designing community events and walking tours.</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Mandarano is an expert in community engagement and capacity building for collective action to address complex social and environmental concerns. Her research explores how everyone from individuals to regional collaborative institutions develop capacities, such as knowledge, relationships and political will to plan and implement projects that have positive, long-term impacts.</p>\r\n<p>This Albert M. Greenfield Civic History Lecture is sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.thealbertmgreenfieldfoundation.org/\">Albert</a><a href=\"http://www.thealbertmgreenfieldfoundation.org/\"> M.

You will receive a registration confirmation email, which includes the Zoom link for the workshop. On the day of the workshop, participants should log into their temple.zoom.us accounts in order to skip the waiting room. If participants are not Temple affiliates, they should use their first and last names in order to be admitted to the session. Participants do not need a video camera or a microphone, but will need an audio connection to hear the instructor.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re pretty savvy with REDCap (or have taken the previous two REDCap workshops in this series), it’s time for a dive into the advanced features of REDCap. You may be familiar with using REDCap to collect survey data for your research, but this versatile service also has many interesting and helpful features that can streamline your methods and open up new avenues for data collection. We will cover: using the calendar tool to track your project, repeatable survey instruments, sending surveys via text (both sending a survey link and sending survey questions themselves), using calculated fields, and data exports.</p>\n\n<p>When you register for this workshop, a REDCap account will be created for you, if you do not already have one. </p>\n\n<p>Please contact Will Dean, the Research and Data Services Librarian at the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, <a href=\"mailto:will.dean@temple.edu\">will.dean@temple.edu</a>,with any questions.</p>\n\n<p>This workshop is the final part of a series of three workshops on REDCap.

Students will learn how to navigate the command line, code in Python, use an integrated development environment, and adapt readymade scripts for text editing, webscraping, and data analytics (including such packages as NLTK, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas). This workshop series will focus on learning how to teach yourself computational skills, to troubleshoot errors, and to learn the basics of a programming language in order to adapt scripts for a wide range of purposes. Students will be introduced to beginner-intermediate level syntax and logic of Python, as well as developing a framework for distinguishing when Python is useful, and when other programming languages are necessary.</p>\n<p>There will be seven workshops in this series.

        "description": "<p>Location: Charles Library Room 315</p>\n<p>This workshop will introduce students to digital methods and resources for learning and leveraging programming languages for scholarly and creative pursuits. Students will learn how to navigate the command line, code in Python, use an integrated development environment, and adapt readymade scripts for text editing, webscraping, and data analytics (including such packages as NLTK, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas). This workshop series will focus on learning how to teach yourself computational skills, to troubleshoot errors, and to learn the basics of a programming language in order to adapt scripts for a wide range of purposes. Students will be introduced to beginner-intermediate level syntax and logic of Python, as well as developing a framework for distinguishing when Python is useful, and when other programming languages are necessary.</p>\n<p>There will be seven workshops in this series. You are not required to come to every one, but consistent attendance is encouraged.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/event/5777368\">https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/event/5777368</a></p>\n\n<p>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

That’s a lot of money!</p>\n<p>\tFaculty can make their courses more affordable for students by adapting their syllabus using content through the library or by assigning an open textbook. Open textbooks are digital books that are free to read, download, and print. </p>\n<p>\tIn this workshop we will provide an introduction to the world of open educational resources and introduce you to the Textbook Affordability Project, a library grant that can help you make the transition to a more affordable course.

        "description": "<p>Join us for this exhibition composed of ten photographs from the recently published book <em>Chasing Light: Michelle Obama Through the Lens of a White House Photographer</em> by Amanda Lucidon (Ten Speed Press, 2017). The book is a collection of striking and intimate photographs of former First Lady Michelle Obama—many never before seen—coupled with personal reflections and behind-the-scenes stories from Official White House Photographer Amanda Lucidon.</p>\n<p>As a capstone to the exhibit, we are pleased to welcome Amanda Lucidon to the Libraries on Monday, January 22 to discuss her book. An award-winning documentarian, filmmaker, and former freelance <em>New York Times</em> photographer, Amanda served as one of the White House photographers responsible for photographing First Lady Michelle Obama from 2013 to 2017. She is one of only a few female White House photographers in history and was the only woman photographer during her time in the Obama White House. Amanda’s work has been honored by Pictures of the Year International, National Press Photographers Association Best of Photojournalism, and the White House News Photographers Association, among others. Visit chasinglightbook.org for more information about her work.</p>\n<p><em>Exhibition on view from January 2 - 23, 2018 on the first floor of Paley Library.</em></p>",

In this workshop, staff from the Wiki Education Foundation will talk about why Wikipedia’s quality is so important and how students can improve academic topics through a classroom assignment. In contributing content to Wikipedia, students gain skills in media literacy, fact-based writing, research, collaboration, and critical thinking. You’ll learn about best practices for using Wikipedia as a teaching tool and how Wiki Ed can support you and your students in this innovative service learning assignment. Staff will also discuss how Science instructors can participate during the Wikipedia Year of Science, though all disciplines are invited and welcome.</p>\n<p>The Instructor<br>\n\tJami Mathewson develops partnerships with educational institutions to increase participation in Wiki Ed’s programs, bring content expertise into the organization, and improve the availability of information related to their disciplines on Wikipedia.

In honor of <a href=\"http://www.openaccessweek.org/\">Open Access Week</a>, join us for a discussion of how Temple University Libraries are working to increase access to information. From helping the City of Philadelphia preserve open civic data, to digitizing and making freely available out-of-print Temple University Press books, learn about some of the different projects the Libraries are undertaking that support not just Temple students and faculty, but the global scholarly community.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.openaccessweek.org/\">Open Access Week</a> is a yearly international celebration that aims to increase awareness about open access (OA). Most academic work is locked up behind a paywall, available only to those who are affiliated with a college or university. Libraries pay publishers millions of dollars a year to provide students and faculty with access to this content. However, many people from outside of the university community could also benefit from access to cutting-edge scholarship.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging this, researchers have begun to look for different ways to make their work more widely available to the general public. OA scholarship is completely free to read and reuse. Researchers can make their work OA by publishing in an OA journal or by sharing a version of their article in an open digital repository (this is often called “self-archiving”). There are also a growing number of publishers who produce OA books and digital projects.</p>\n<p>\t </p>",

We apologize for the inconvenience.*</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the late 1960s, a group of graduate students affiliated with Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) established a journal called <em>Radical America</em>. The journal uncovered the historical roots of present-day issues facing working-class men and women, challenged the idea that students did not care about unions, and celebrated the vibrant (but often hidden) currents of radical multiracial and multicultural movements. In 2011, twelve years after <em>Radical America</em> ceased publication, the magazine <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/\"><em>Jacobin</em></a> was founded. Started by an undergraduate student, it has grown to become one of the leading voices of the American left, publishing the work of radical journalists, academics, and artists, and championing movements for social justice.</p>\n<p>Please join us for a conversation with <em>Jacobin</em> founding editor Bhaskar Sunkara and former <em>Radical America</em> editor Allen Hunter about the role of students and labor activism in 2018. What can today’s students learn from students of the 1960s? How can labor and other social movements involve students and be responsive to their ideas, needs, and aspirations? And how can magazines, blogs, and other publications help students amplify their voices?</p>\n<p>Moderated by Minju Bae, a PhD Candidate in the History Department at Temple University.</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://tupress.temple.edu/open-access/labor-studies/6\">Workers’ Struggles, Past and Present: A “Radical America” Reader</a>, edited by James Green, was reissued by Temple University Press in 2018 and is now freely available to read online.

Blockson Afro-American Collection</p>\r\n<p>Celebrates Jazz through the music of Robert “Bootsie” Barnes</p>\r\n<p>“Put it this way: Jazz is a good barometer of freedom… In its beginnings, the United States of America spawned certain ideals of freedom and independence through which, eventually, jazz was evolved, and the music is so free that many people say it is the only unhampered, unhindered expression of complete freedom yet produced in this country.“ —Duke Ellington </p>\r\n<p>Join us for a virtual celebration of Black Music Month featuring the late Philadelphia jazz legend Robert “Bootsie” Barnes. We’ll show photographs throughout the years to the tune of his recording “Cosby’s Capers,” aka “Boppin’ Round the Center.”  Bootsie’s wife Sandra Turner Barnes will read the poem “The Bop in Blue,” while Bootsie’s grandson Reginald Lewis and band will perform “Three Miles Out.” We will also remember Bootsie Barnes through sharing a video of  his performance at the Blockson Collection in 2014.</p>\r\n<p>The program will be held online via Zoom.

Like many ingenious ideas - Truesdell began the process that would eventually become the Adaptive Design Association in a garage. At that time she was trying to come up with simple and affordable solutions to assist her aunt after an acquired spinal cord injury. For over thirty years, an equity-based entrepreneurial spirit pervades Truesdell's Adaptive Design Association, Inc. With a \"Never Say No\" policy, the Adaptive Design Association refuses no one care.</p>\n<p>Assisting thousands of children and adults around the world every year, the Adaptive Design Association is a global force for good in the disabilities community and beyond. Alex has taught hundreds of courses in adaptive design to professionals and parents throughout the Northeast, and through the Hilton-Perkins International Program, has trained educators in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Poland, and Guatemala.</p>\n<p>As ADA’s founding director, Alex draws on her tenure as founder and coordinator of the Assistive Device Center at the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, MA—a school recognized internationally as a leader in the education of children who are blind and deaf-blind. In 1996, Alex was awarded a fellowship in International Community Development co-sponsored by the Partners of the Americas and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. In addition to her experience in the field, Alex holds a Master's degree in Teaching the Visually Impaired from Boston College, and a Master's degree in Curriculum Development from Lesley University. Alex is co-author of the book Creative Constructions: Technologies that make adaptive design accessible, affordable, inclusive and fun.</p>\n<p><strong>Register at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alex-truesdell-and-the-adaptive-design-association-tickets-36963356394\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/alex-truesdell-and-the-adaptive-design-asso...</a>.</strong></p>",

Art+Feminism Wikipedia Edit-a-thon, a global project improving content on cis and trans women, the arts, and feminism on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>The gender gap on Wikipedia is no secret. In 2011, The Wikimedia Foundation found that less than 10% of editors on the platform were women. When we’re not represented in the writing and editing of the stories and records of people like us, the content gets messed up. The stories get mistold. We lose out on the real history. That’s why we’re here: to change it.</p>\n<p>This year, Art+Feminism is expanding their project focus to include correcting and expanding the histories of gender non-binary artists and activists on Wikipedia.</p>\n<p>We will provide tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, reference materials, and refreshments, and invite people of all gender identities and expressions to participate, particularly transgender and cisgender women. We hope you’ll also join us in the evening for a panel discussion on the intersection of art, feminism, technology, and history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/artfeminism-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-tickets-55509946745\">Registration</a> is encouraged.</p>\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>Please BYO laptop!</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>#artandfeminism</strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong><strong>#AF6</strong></strong></p>\n\n<p>Following the edit-a-thon, we will host a panel discussion on art, feminism, technology, and history in the digital age to wrap up the day.

In a 2011 survey, the Wikimedia Foundation found that less than 10% of its contributors identify as female; more recent research points to 16% globally and 22% in the US. The data relative to trans and non-binary editors is basically non-existent. That's a big problem. While the reasons for the gender gap are up for debate, the practical effect of this disparity is not: gaps in participation create gaps in content.</p>\n<p>Let's change that. Join us for the seventh annual (and our fifth!)

Over the course of this lecture series, we will reflect on the past, present, and future of American journalism, history, and culture. For our inaugural program, we are focusing on Philadelphia Neighborhoods, which is a publication that produces and shares stories about the neighborhoods of Philadelphia and is part of the Multimedia Urban Reporting Lab at Klein College of Media and Communication.</p>\r\n<p>About Philadelphia Neighborhoods</p>\r\n<p>For more than a decade, students in Temple's Journalism Department have produced news for and about underserved and underreported communities throughout Philadelphia, publishing their work on the hyperlocal news website, <a href=\"http://philadelphianeighborhoods.com\">PhiladelphiaNeighborhoods.com</a>. The publication is the culmination of students' coursework, and producing stories for the website trains students in reporting news that is informed by perspectives that rarely make it into news stories published by other outlets. Made in North Philly, Philadelphia Neighborhoods' student journalists bring their journalistic knowledge and sense of public service into neighborhoods throughout the city.</p>\r\n<p>PhiladelphiaNeighborhoods.com occupies a unique place in Philadelphia's media ecology, publishing on a broad range of issues that affect the lives of communities. These reporters cover issues and communities often neglected by much of the local news media, at the same time producing a record that shows what it means to live in Philadelphia during a time of significant local and national change.</p>\r\n<p>The McLean Contributionship <em>Philadelphia Evening Bulletin</em> Endowed Lecture Series is generously supported by The McLean Contributionship.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://temple.zoom.us/j/92107812677\">https://temple.zoom.us/j/92107812677</a></p>\r\n<p>All programs are free and open to all, and registration is encouraged. </p>",

She's also a dedicated mother, drummer, food justice activist, and community organizer. As an Agro-Africanist, she has a passion for preserving and creating cultural traditions through nutrition, growing food, seedkeeping, and advocacy.</p>\n<p><strong>Dara Cooper</strong> is a national organizer with the National Black Food and Justice Alliance, an alliance of Black led organizations working towards national Black food and land justice.

Delany taught in the Temple English department for many years. His science fiction and fantasy tales are available in<em> </em><em>Aye, and Gomorrah: And Other Stories</em>. His has two experimental fiction collections, <em>Atlantis: Three Tales </em>and <em>Phallos</em>, while his novels include science fiction such as the Nebula-Award winning Babel-17,<em> The Einstein Intersection</em>, <em>Nova </em>(now in a Library of America anthology), <em>Dhalgren</em>, and <em>Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders</em>. His book-length autobiographical essay, The Motion of Light in Water, won a Hugo Award in 1989. </p>\n<p>Bill Wood graduated from the University of Maine’s Honors College in 2011 with a BA in English and Philosophy. In 2013, he also received his MA in English with a creative writing focus there. Bill was accepted to Temple University’s MFA program in 2014, where he met—and sadly only had one class with—Samuel Delany, now his boss and good friend. Bill is currently working on a science fiction series,<em> A Little Bit of Chaos</em>, part of which can be found on Amazon.</p>\n<p>Michael Swanwick has received a Hugo Award for fiction in an unprecedented five out of six consecutive years and has been honored with the Nebula, Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy Awards. He has the pleasant distinction of losing more of those awards than any other writer in the history of the field. He has written ten novels, over 150 stories, and countless works of flash fiction.</p>\n<p><em>Please contact Richie Holland at <a href=\"mailto:richieh@temple.edu\" target=\"_blank\">r</a><a href=\"mailto:ichieh@temple.edu\" target=\"_blank\">ichieh@temple.edu</a> or 215-204-3455 to request an accommodation, or with questions/concerns about accessibility.

        "description": "<p>Games Without Frontiers Artist/Makers Residency</p>\n<p>What's Love Got to Do With It: Lindsay Grace Explains Affection Gaming</p>\n<p>Affection Games are a casual play genre in which players hug, flirt, kiss or make love to meet their game goals. There are more than 500 digital affection games currently available to play. This presentation playfully demonstrates a cross section of digital affection games and their conventions. From unicorns kissing in the clouds to star-crossed lovers sneaking off into the night, the genre is evolving. Are these games the yin to violent games yang? In the ever widening demographic of game players, Affection Games offer a refreshing perspective on how we play. This talk outlines the variety of affection games providing a fun, informative and inspiring review of affection play in games. What games are popular, how are they played and what do they say about gender and affection dynamics?​</p>\n<p>Lindsay Grace is an associate professor at American University and founding director of the American University Game Lab and Studio. His game designs have received awards from leading organizations around the world and he has given talks at the Game Developer's Conference, the Games for Change Festival/Tribeca Film Festival, and many others. He has published more than 40 papers, articles, and book chapters on games, while his creative work has been selected for showcase in more than eight countries and 12 states. He is currently the Vice President of the Global Game Jam™ and serves on the board of directors for the Digital Games Research Association. He is a key partner in American University’s Knight Foundation-funded Jolt initiative to reimagine media leadership through game design and systems thinking.</p>\n<p>The Games Without Frontiers residency is generously co-sponsored by the General Education Program at Temple University.</p>",

        "description": "<p>Begin the New Year with a festive musical celebration! On Wednesday, January 25, Paley Library’s Beyond the Notes concert series will be proud to present professors of piano Clipper Erickson, Charles Abramovic and Joyce Lindorff, joined by Risë Kagan-Erickson on bells, and flutist Martha Alford in performance of music for bells and piano music inspired by the sounds of bells. This concert features music by composers whose names may be unfamiliar, even among those who are otherwise familiar with classical music, including some contemporary composers; accordingly, introductions to a series of multi-talented individuals are in order.</p>\n<p>For full details visit: <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/performingartsnews/2017/01/13/ring-in-the-new-year/\">https://sites.temple.edu/performingartsnews/2017/01/13/ring-in-the-new-y...</a></p>\n<p><em>This program is part of the Libraries' Beyond the Page public programming series.</em></p>\n<p>Beyond the Notes<em> is supported by the Boyer College, Temple University Libraries, and the Presidential Humanities and Arts Research fund.</em></p>",

Join us for a conversation with Ariell Johnson, owner of <a href=\"https://amalgamphilly.com/\">Amalgam Comics &amp; Coffeehouse</a>, James Darrin Hillyard, Jr. of <a href=\"https://www.blackandnobel.com/collections\">Black and Nobel</a>, and Jeannine Cook, owner of <a href=\"https://www.harriettsbookshop.com/\">Harriett’s Bookshop</a>, about their experiences running local bookshops.</p>\n\n<p><strong>About the speakers:</strong></p>\n<p>For the last 10 years <strong>Jeannine A. Cook</strong> has worked as a trusted writer for several startups, corporations, non-profits, influencers, and most recently herself. In addition to holding a master’s degree from The University of the Arts, Jeannine is also a winner of the South Philly Review Difference Maker Award. Jeannine opened Harriett’s Bookshop in 2020 and is currently producing an art installation of her writings deconstructed into paper art sculptures, collages, and calligrams called Conversations With Harriett.</p>\n\n<p><strong>James Darrin Hillyard, Jr.</strong> is a South Philadelphia artist who left and came back to South Street as a part of Black and Nobel, a cultural center that ships books to prisons and provides a variety of products like knowledge books and all natural products, like Sea Moss Gold. </p>\n\n<p>A true child of the 80s, <strong>Ariell R. Johnson</strong>, Fox ‘05 grew up on a diet of He-Man, She-Ra, Thundercats, &amp; Transformers. With the love and support of her family and friends, she turned this passion into a career at the age of 32 when she opened Amalgam Comics &amp; Coffeehouse in Philadelphia; a comic book store and coffee shop hybrid. Amalgam is the only black-woman owned comic book store on the East Coast. Amalgam, which opened on December 14, 2015, just celebrated its 5th birthday!</p>\n\n<p>On the day of the program, use this link to join: <a href=\"https://temple.zoom.us/j/95766148759\">https://temple.zoom.us/j/95766148759</a>. </p>",

Today’s digital technologies offer tremendous advantages, from quick access to information and effortless communications to convenient online shopping and commercial transactions. This ease of access can come at a price, however, as Internet providers and web sites track your online behavior and sell your private information and hackers seek to breach your financial accounts and intercept your personal and business communications. Take the necessary steps to protect yourself!</p>\n<p>This workshop will provide tools and tips for protecting your digital security and privacy. Here are some questions we will answer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can I manage all my passwords?</li>\n<li>What options are available for browsing anonymously online?</li>\n<li>How can I chat online privately?</li>\n<li>Where can I learn more about digital privacy and security?</li>\n</ul>",

Who’s creating the work we see around the city? How does access to art and arts education shape who’s invited to participate in our city’s creative placemaking? And what role can public art play in sparking conversation, empowerment, empathy, and understanding around important social and political issues?</p>\n<p>About the Organizers:</p>\n<p><strong>Cindy M. Ngo</strong> is currently the promotions manager at Social Impact Studios, the co-founder of <em>Eat Up The Borders</em>, and a lifelong Philadelphian. Her latest project will take her across the country as a creative collaborator to share the stories for the 2018-19 Intercultural Leadership Institute cohort of fellows, an intensive leadership development program that brings together rising artists and culture bearers from marginalized communities across the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Conrad Benner</strong> is a photographer, podcaster, curator, and founder of <a href=\"https://streetsdept.com/\">StreetsDept.com</a>, a photo-blog that discovers art on the streets of Philadelphia. Conrad’s blog has been named one of the ‘Best Blogs for Travellers’ by The Guardian, and his photography has been highlighted by Mashable and Instagram, as well as printed in Time Magazine and the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/philly-public-arts-forum-the-art-on-our-streets-tickets-48660364460\">Registration</a> is encouraged.</p>",

Gram decided it was time for her grandchildren to know the contributions made by their ancestors. So, she gathers her grandchildren together for a family history lesson. Her lesson begins with Cyrus Bustill, who was born enslaved, purchased his freedom, operated a successful bakery business, and provided bread to George Washington's troops camped at Valley Forge during the Revolutionary War. He was a businessman, an educator, and a leader in the Black community. His children and grandchildren continued Cyrus' legacy of leadership as they were agents in the Underground Railroad, soldiers in the United States Colored Troops (USCT) during the Civil War, and advocates fighting for the right to vote for all. Gram's gift to her grandchildren is their family history.</p>\r\n<p>Author Joyce Mosley assumed the role of family historian over 30 years ago. She has documented her African-American family history to European settlers and Cyrus Bustill. Joyce has presented her family research at genealogy conferences and regional meetings including the African-American Historical and Genealogical Society and the African-American Genealogy Group.</p>\r\n<p>This program is part of the Black Lives Always Mattered! public program series at the Blockson Collection, which has been supported by The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage.</p>\r\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom.

        "description": "<p>This workshop will be offered as an online session via Zoom. You will receive the Zoom link the day before the session, in an email. On the day of the workshop, participants should log into their <a href=\"http://temple.zoom.us/\" target=\"_blank\">temple.zoom.us</a> accounts in order to skip the waiting room. If participants are not Temple affiliates, they should use their first and last names in order to be admitted to the session. Participants do not need a video camera or a microphone, but will need an audio connection to hear the instructor.</p>\n\n<p>This workshop presents an overview of REDCap, (Research Electronic Data Capture). While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data (including 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, and HIPAA-compliant environments), it is specifically geared to support online or offline data capture for research studies and operations. In this workshop we will go over: creating a project, navigating REDCap, the data dictionary and codebook, creating and editing instruments and fields, data entry, and basic surveys.</p>\n\n<p>It is recommended that you register for this workshop ahead of time so a REDCap account can be created for you, if you do not already have one.</p>\n\n<p>Please contact Will Dean, the Research and Data Services Librarian at the Ginsburg Health Sciences Library, <a href=\"mailto:will.dean@temple.edu\">will.dean@temple.edu</a>,with any questions</p>",

The network is open to anyone working in or adjacent to the humanities.</p>\n<p>\t<em>Humanities Commons</em> was designed by scholarly societies in the humanities to serve the needs of humanists as they engage in teaching and research that benefit the larger community. Unlike other social and academic communities, Humanities Commons is open-access, open-source, and nonprofit. It is focused on providing a space to discuss, share, and store cutting-edge research and innovative pedagogy—not on generating profits from users' intellectual and personal data.</p>\n<p>\tQuestions?

It is important, though, not to oversimplify what constitutes predatory practices.

You may be familiar with using REDCap to collect survey data for your research, but this versatile service also has many interesting and helpful features that can streamline your methods and open up new avenues for data collection. We will cover: using the calendar tool to track your project, repeatable survey instruments, sending surveys via text (both sending a survey link and sending survey questions themselves), using calculated fields, and data exports.</p>\n\n<p>It is recommended that you register for this workshop ahead of time so a REDCap account can be created for you, if you do not already have one.</p>\n\n<p>This is part of a series of three workshops on REDCap.

        "description": "<p>The need to increase diversity and inclusion in the field of engineering is widely recognized as a critical issue in our profession.  This has resulted in an abundance of research and vigorous efforts to increase participation of underrepresented groups in engineering; however, there is a paucity of research on LGBTQ+ inclusion and participation in engineering.  Despite the recent advances in LGBTQ+ equality through legislation and societal acceptance in some countries around the world, LGBTQ+ individuals face exclusion, discrimination and overt hostility in many environments – including classrooms and workplaces.  In 2015, the American Society for Engineering Education established a Virtual Community of Practice (VCP) for LGBTQ+ Inclusion in STEM academic departments, with support from the National Science Foundation.  This presentation describes the VCP’s research-education-advocacy efforts and highlights initiatives advanced by VCP members at ASEE, AIChE and academic institutions. Following the talk, this will also be an opportunity to discuss issues of diversity and inclusion in STEM at Temple University.</p>\n<p>\tDr. Stephanie Farrell is Interim Dean of the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering at Rowan University and Professor and Founding Chair of the Department of Experiential Engineering Education (ExEEd).  Stephanie began her career as a faculty member in the Chemical Engineering Department at Louisiana Tech University.  She joined Rowan as a founding faculty member of the Chemical Engineering Department in 1998, where she served until launching ExEEd in 2016.

Enter policy surveillance and other methods of scientific legal mapping that track laws and policies across jurisdictions or institutions, and over time. Using methods developed by Temple’s own Center for Public Health Law Research, researchers, advocates, government officials, and others are objectively capturing the important features of laws and policies for use in research and practice.</p>\r\n<p>In this event, learn more about the roots of policy surveillance, how law and policy data are making a difference in public health and law, and how the Center is applying innovative technology solutions to capturing and evaluating the law to improve health and advance open science. Stick around at the end of the event for a Q&amp;A session.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to this program, we will be hosting a number of Love Data Week workshops—visit <a href=\"http://library.temple.edu/workshops\">library.temple.edu/workshops</a> for more.</p>\r\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom Webinar.

Wikipedia’s gender trouble is well-documented. In a 2011 survey, the Wikimedia Foundation found that less than 10% of its contributors were women. While the reasons for the gender gap are up for debate, the practical effect of this disparity is not: content is skewed by the lack of representation from women. Let’s change that.</p>\n<p>We will provide tutorials for the beginner Wikipedian, reference materials, and refreshments, and invite people of all gender identities and expressions to participate, particularly transgender and cisgender women.</p>\n<p><strong>Panel starts at 11:00 AM/Training starts at 12:30 PM/Editing in full swing at 1:30 PM.</strong> Drop in at any time!</p>\n<p><strong>Kindly register at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/artfeminism-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-2018-tickets-42211588999\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/artfeminism-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-2018-tickets-42211588999</a>. </strong></p>\n<p> <br>\n </p>",

        "description": "<p>In honor of Open Access Week, visit the Libraries for a special exhibit that profiles a few of the many Temple University faculty members who are committed to reaching a wide audience with their research. These faculty come from different disciplines, schools, and colleges, yet they all believe that scholarly information deserves to be read and used beyond the walls of the academy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.openaccessweek.org/\">Open Access Week</a> is a yearly international celebration that aims to increase awareness about open access (OA). Most academic work is locked up behind a paywall, available only to those who are affiliated with a college or university. Libraries pay publishers millions of dollars a year to provide students and faculty with access to this content. However, many people from outside of the university community could also benefit from access to cutting-edge scholarship.</p>\n<p>Acknowledging this, researchers have begun to look for different ways to make their work more widely available to the general public. OA scholarship is completely free to read and reuse. Researchers can make their work OA by publishing in an OA journal or by sharing a version of their article in an open digital repository (this is often called “self-archiving”). There are also a growing number of publishers who produce OA books and digital projects.</p>",

Sarkeesian’s talk also includes examples of games and communities that do get it right, and what we can learn from missteps and successes alike. Sarkeesian is the creator of Feminist Frequency, a video webseries that explores the representations of women in pop culture narratives and deconstructs the associated stereotypes and tropes.</p>\n<p>This program is co-sponsored by the College of Liberal Arts, the Honors Program, Teaching, Learning and Technology Roundtable, Computer Services, and the School of Media and Communication at Temple University.

        "description": "<p><strong>WHAT: </strong>Art+Feminism Wikipedia Edit-a-thon is an international communal updating of Wikipedia content on subjects related to art and feminism. Universities and cultural institutions around the city of Philadelphia are hosting edit-a-thons throughout the month of March, where participants will gather in one place to edit, add, and improve Wikipedia entries.</p>\n<p><strong>WHY:</strong> Art+Feminism Wikipedia-a-thon improves coverage of women and the arts on Wikipedia and encourages female editorship. Wikimedia Foundation found that less than 10% of its contributors identify as female. While the reasons for the gender gap are debateable, the effect is not. Content is skewed by the lack of female participation, creating imbalance in this increasingly important repository of shared knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>HOW: </strong>Register <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/art-feminism-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-2017-tickets-31549440225\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/art-feminism-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-2017-tickets-31549440225</a>, arrive with your laptop or device, power cord, and ideas for entries. It’s that simple. We will provide tutorials for beginner Wikipedians, reference materials, and refreshments.</p>\n<p><strong>Since 2014, over 280 Art+Feminism edit-a-thons have taken place across the world, creating and improving an estimated 4,600 articles.

Can you make contact with the souls of the departed—with ghosts? The conviction that both things are true was the cornerstone of Spiritualism, a worldwide movement that reached its peak a hundred years ago. Its foremost spokesman was Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of the hyper-rational detective Sherlock Holmes. He was friends with the great escape artist Harry Houdini—until Houdini tried to expose the Boston medium Mina Crandon, whose séances with her dead brother, Walter, had attracted the attention of <em>Scientific American</em> magazine. The detailed records of these séances provide a fascinating look at a forgotten practice, and the ominous predictions of Houdini’s death will send chills down your spine.</p>\n<p><strong>Laurence Roy Stains</strong> is an associate professor of journalism at Temple. He is the author, with Stefan Bechtel, of the newly published book <em>Through a Glass, Darkly: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle &amp; the Quest to Solve the Greatest Mystery of All</em> (St. Martin’s). He has written for many national magazines and won a National Magazine Award in 2011.</p>\n<p>This program is part of the Libraries' <em>Beyond the Page</em> public programming series.</p>",

        "description": "<p>So you’ve had the soil tested and it’s not good news. Can plants help remediate your site’s contaminants? Cost-effective phytoremediation (phytotechnology) plantings can be effective in mitigating on-site pollutants, but these interactions are complicated. When do they work and when don’t they? What plant species can be used? There is a lot of confusion around what phytotechnology can and cannot accomplish. However, with careful research and planning, integrating this relatively new technology into design work can result in huge financial and environmental benefits. This talk will review the tools to create ‘phyto’ landscapes that enhance environmental conditions. A summary of plant species and example projects will be provided.</p>\n<p>Kate Kennen is a landscape architect, and founder of Offshoots, Inc. (<a href=\"http://www.offshootsinc.com\">www.offshootsinc.com</a>) a Boston, MA design practice focused on productive planting techniques and phytotechnology consulting. Kate earned her undergraduate degree from Cornell University and Master’s Degree in Landscape Architecture with distinction from Harvard University. Kate’s recent book, <em>PHYTO: Principles and Resources for Site Remediation and Landscape Design</em> has received national awards and was named one of the top 10 new landscape books by ASLA in 2015.</p>\n<p><em>This program is part of our </em>Seeing Stories: Visualizing Sustainable Citizenship<em> series, co-curated by Temple Contemporary, Temple University’s Office of Sustainability, and Temple University Libraries, along with faculty and graduate students from the Tyler School of Art, the College of Liberal Arts, and the Center for the Cinematic and Performing Arts. </em></p>\n<p><em>This program is also co-sponsored by the Department of Landscape Architecture and Horticulture, Ambler Campus and is made possible through the use of GAF funds. </em></p>",

        "description": "<p>What are the practical implications of an AI-enabled world? As we think about the possibilities for digital campuses, corporations, and communities in the future, it is important to keep in mind the limits of technology in solving social problems. Despite the optimistic promises of digital evangelists, it has become clear that most large-scale software systems exacerbate existing social inequality. As algorithms are increasingly used to make decisions on our behalf, it is important to ask: how can journalists hold algorithms (and their creators) accountable?</p>\n<p>In this talk, author and professor Meredith Broussard looks at the inner workings and outer limits of technology, and explains why we should never assume that computers always get things right. Making a case against “technochauvinism”—the belief that technology is always the solution—Broussard looks at why self-driving cars don’t really work and why social problems persist in every digital Utopia. If we understand the limits of what we can do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we should do with it to make the world better for everyone. </p>\n<p>Meredith Broussard is an associate professor at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University and the author of Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World.</p>\n\n<p>Presented in collaboration with the Klein College of Media and Communication</p>\n<p>Presented as part of Love Data Week.

Simultaneously, photography culture blossomed—marking the Civil War as the first conflict to be extensively documented through photographs.

        "description": "<p>Open science has played an important role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The urgency of the situation has shown us how crucial access to scientific knowledge is, both now and in the future. In this workshop, we'll discuss 5 simple ways researchers can get started with integrating open science practices into their own work. These include: pre-registering your research, posting a preprint, sharing your data or code, collaborating with your team using an open source platform, and publishing in an open access journal.</p>\n<p>This workshop will be offered as an online session via Zoom. You must register for this workshop to receive the Zoom link via a confirmation email. On the day of the workshop, use the link to join the session. Participants do not need a video camera or a microphone, but will need an audio connection to hear the instructor.</p>\n<p>Contact Annie Johnson at <a href=\"mailto:annie.johnson@temple.edu\">annie.johnson@temple.edu</a> with any questions. </p>",

Students will learn how to navigate the command line, code in Python, use an integrated development environment, and adapt readymade scripts for text editing, webscraping, and data analytics (including such packages as NLTK, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas). This workshop series will focus on learning how to teach yourself computational skills, to troubleshoot errors, and to learn the basics of a programming language in order to adapt scripts for a wide range of purposes. Students will be introduced to beginner-intermediate level syntax and logic of Python, as well as developing a framework for distinguishing when Python is useful, and when other programming languages are necessary.</p>\n<p>There will be seven workshops in this series.

        "description": "<p>1968 was a year that changed our world. The year brought us both the King and Kennedy assassinations and the opening Off-Broadway of <em>The Boys in the Band</em>, the groundbreaking play featuring gay characters. Women’s liberation groups protested the Miss America contest and Tommie Smith and John Carlos clenched their fists in a black power salute at the Mexico City Summer Olympic Games. New York democrat Shirley Chisholm was elected as the first Black female U.S. Representative and students protested at Columbia University, in Mexico City, and around Europe. Locally, four Black boys entered Girard College after a 14-year desegregation battle and Progress Plaza was dedicated as an example of positive urban renewal and investment.</p>\n\n<p>On February 29, 1968, President Johnson’s National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders (also known as the Kerner Commission) warned racism was causing America to move “toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal.”</p>\n<p>Join us for a conversation celebrating and reflecting on 1968 and the legacy of the Kerner Commission with Steven M. Gillon and Alan Curtis, moderated by Karen M.

        "description": "<p>Twenty years ago, Phyllis Palmer published <em>Domesticity and Dirt: Housewives and Domestic Servants in the United States, 1920-1945</em>. The book recounts how white middle-class housewives focused on what were seen as more refined aspects of keeping house, relegating the hard physical work and demeaning service tasks to servants—mainly women of color. It has now been reissued in a freely available online format by Temple University Press. In celebration of its return, please join us for a talk by historian Premilla Nadasen.</p>\n\n<p>Using <em>Domesticity and Dirt</em> as a launching pad, Nadasen will discuss the women of color who took over domestic responsibilities in white homes in the 1960s and 1970s. During that time, African American household workers formed the first-ever national organization to represent them. They developed innovative strategies to mobilize workers who had historically been considered outside the boundaries of \"legitimate\" labor. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Premilla Nadasen is a Professor of History at Barnard College, a 2018-2019 Fulbright Scholar, and President of the National Women’s Studies Association. She is the author of two award-winning books <em>Welfare Warriors: The Welfare Rights Movement in the United States</em> (Routledge 2005) and <em>Household Workers Unite: The Untold Story of African American Women Who Built a Movement</em> (Beacon 2015).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/history-memory-and-household-worker-organizing-premilla-nadasen-professor-of-history-barnard-college-tickets-57795549043\">Registration </a>is encouraged. </p>\n<p><em>This event has been made possible in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities: Exploring the human endeavor.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://tupress.temple.edu/open-access/labor-studies/23\">Domesticity and Dirt</a><em><em>, by Phyllis Palmer, was reissued by Temple University Press in 2018 and is now freely available online.</em></em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><em>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

        "description": "<p>Location: Charles Library Room 315</p>\n<p>This workshop will introduce students to digital methods and resources for learning and leveraging programming languages for scholarly and creative pursuits. Students will learn how to navigate the command line, code in Python, use an integrated development environment, and adapt readymade scripts for text editing, webscraping, and data analytics (including such packages as NLTK, Beautiful Soup, and Pandas). This workshop series will focus on learning how to teach yourself computational skills, to troubleshoot errors, and to learn the basics of a programming language in order to adapt scripts for a wide range of purposes. Students will be introduced to beginner-intermediate level syntax and logic of Python, as well as developing a framework for distinguishing when Python is useful, and when other programming languages are necessary.</p>\n<p>There will be seven workshops in this series. You are not required to come to every one, but consistent attendance is encouraged.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/event/5777368\">https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/event/5777368</a></p>\n\n<p>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

Their book, They Carried Us: The Social Impact of Philadelphia’s Black Women Leaders, will introduce you to some of Philadelphia’s fiercest Black women leaders, ranging from the first Black woman known to be born in Philadelphia (1694) to the woman whose childhood experiences led her to become a surgeon and medical advisor to celebrities. All of the women “bring it” as activists— in community and movement work, business and civic institutions, education, faith, medicine, law and government, journalism, sports, and the arts. They have had larger-than-life impacts on the city, the country, and the world.</p>\r\n<p>Historical research and original interviews of contemporary women place Philadelphia’s Black women on center stage, showing how their efforts snowballed into a Philadelphia community of women which spanned geographies, sectors, and time.</p>\r\n<p>The words of the book’s contemporary women are memorable. One woman observed that if the authors “had not written this book it wouldn’t have been done.” Another said, “This is who Black women are. Not just me, but Black women.” The authors’ experiences as activists, researchers, and educators—and of frequently being the “only Black women in the room”— fills the book not just with facts, but with genuine empathy.</p>\r\n<p>This program is part of the Black Lives Always Mattered! public program series at the Blockson Collection, which is made possible through the support of the Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage grant.</p>\r\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom.

They are hard-working underdogs of high character who do battle and win. They fled lives as domestics and sharecroppers to empower themselves while working in war production and U.S. government offices. These patriotic pioneers share their wartime memories, recounting their battles against racism at home, Nazism abroad, and sexism everywhere. </p>\n<p><em></em>Register at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/invisible-warriors-african-american-women-of-world-war-ii-tickets-71530442479\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/invisible-warriors-african-american-women-of-world-war-ii-tickets-71530442479</a></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

        "description": "<p>The most prolific contemporary African American scholar who has published 92 books, Dr. Molefi Kete Asante joins the Blockson Collection in a thoughtful and provocative talk about his latest works, \"Ama Mazama: The Ogunic Presence in Africology\" and \"An Afrocentric Pan Africanist Vision.\" Dr. Asante is professor and chair of the Department of Africology and African American Studies at Temple University. “Asante’s visionary work weaves together seamlessly fractured pieces of thought on Pan Africanism. He highlights the ideas and actions of major leaders in its creation. In this way, the reader can see more clearly how the roles of Pan African leaders have been part of a necessary process of Pan Africanism’s development. Recognizing the necessity of understanding the significance of culture as the dominant factor in the conquest of Africa and her people, Asante challenges the acceptance of anti-African cultures and suggests ways in which Afrocentric knowledge as a cultural tool can offer the basis for African cultural unity not as a dream but as a reality. I highly recommend this book for those interested in the study of Africa and Pan Africanism and its continuing development as a force for positive change.” —Nah Dove, Temple University</p>\n\n<p>This program will be presented via Zoom.

In order to reduce the risk of exposing sensitive data or violating someone’s privacy, the researcher may use a geographic mask, a set of techniques which change the location of points on a map to protect privacy without overly changing spatial patterns.</p>\n<p>\tMaskMy.XYZ is a tool that simplifies geographic masking: there is nothing to install, data remains on a user’s computer, and a knowledge of GIS is not necessary. It uses popular open source JavaScript libraries to mask data without ever requiring users to install or download any software. MaskMy.XYZ does donut masking: each point is randomly moved between a minimum and maximum distance, confined to a space resembling a donut. If you use maps, join us to learn more about this easy but effective tool.</p>\n<p>\tPlease contact Greg McKinney, <a href=\"mailto:gregmck@temple.edu\">gregmck@temple.edu</a>, with any questions.</p>",

Watson.</p>\n<p>Born on February 10, 1926 in the Philadelphia area, Cal Massey started drawing at the age of four by tracing newspaper cartoons. Upon graduating from high school, he served in the military as a mechanic. After his tour of duty, he studied life drawing and illustration at the Hussian School in Philadelphia, where he later joined the faculty.</p>\n<p>Massey began his art career by working in the comic book industry, illustrating science fiction and war stories. In the 1970s, he worked for the Franklin Mint, producing the first commemorative medal—a Douglas MacArthur memorial medal—as well as over 200 other medallic designs. More recently, he designed a commemorative medal for the Atlanta Olympic Games. Using watercolors and acrylics, many of Massey’s best known works are his paintings of statuesque Africans in native costume.</p>\n<p>Register at <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/celebrating-the-art-of-cal-massey-with-richard-j-watson-tickets-71513220969\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/celebrating-the-art-of-cal-massey-with-richard-j-watson-tickets-71513220969</a></p>\n<p>\n\t<em>Programs offered by Temple University Libraries are accessible to people with disabilities.

She, along with Bri Barton, is a co-founder of the Water Ways project, a collaboratively-drawn series of highly detailed pen and ink illustrations telling the story of water and the effects that the natural gas industry has on the area commonly known as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Each illustration consists of dozens of small vignettes that highlight people’s struggles as they strive to protect the water and land on which we all survive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/midday-arts-series-an-afternoon-with-ryan-eckes-and-meg-lemieur-tickets-50493700016\">Registration</a> requested.</p>\n<p>Photo courtesy Brae Howard.</p>\n<p>A special thanks to the Intellectual Heritage Department at Temple University for sponsoring this program.</p>",

This exhibit, sponsored by the National Library of Medicine, was initially intended to make a stop at Temple University’s Ginsburg Health Sciences Library during September 2020. In light of the coronavirus pandemic, traveling exhibits are paused and we will celebrate instead with a virtual exhibit, workshops and speaking events.</p>\n<p>All students at the Health Sciences Center Campus will become practicing healthcare workers. They will be confronted with issues similar to those that medical practitioners faced in the time of the yellow fever epidemic, such as how politics can impact medical care. Biases can occur through all stages of the literature search process: from the way study results are reported, to how books and articles are indexed in library catalogs and databases, and to dangerous algorithms in search engines. In this workshop, you will learn about implicit bias in health sciences research, and we will offer strategies for how to avoid these biases. This will help students, faculty and healthcare practitioners find unbiased information to use in their clinical care and to advocate for their patients.<br>\n\tContact <a href=\"mailto:courtney.eger@temple.edu\">courtney.eger@temple.edu</a>, for more information. </p>",
