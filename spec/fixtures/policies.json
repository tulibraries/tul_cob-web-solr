        "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Temple University Libraries are available as a site for filming.  Please read the guidelines below and be specific in filling out the request form. The form link is at the bottom of the page. The request will be reviewed by a member of the Library Administration.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Guidelines for Requesting Permission to Use the Libraries for Filming</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The University Libraries are occasionally approached by students or external filmmakers interested in using the library as a site for filming. Filming presents a potential for disruption of the study environment and therefore the Libraries require that the filmmakers observe the following guidelines to be considered for filming.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Review Criteria</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Generally, we attempt to support filming by Temple students undertaken to fulfill curricular requirements or student organization related projects.  We do require that filmmakers submit their requests in advance and specify the program and course or project, the type and number of crew members, and provide a mobile number for the director.  Each production should make an effort to minimize the amount of noise, movement, or other disruptions to the study environment.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While we will consider requests from external filmmakers, there are additional concerns since external non-student productions are often larger, more elaborate and potentially disruptive in a variety of ways. External productions may also entail liability and security issues.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Non-Temple (external) filmmakers that want to film in the Charles Library or other locations on campus will need to contact Ray Betzner (<a href=\"mailto:betzner@temple.edu\">betzner@temple.edu</a>) in <a href=\"https://www.temple.edu/about/news-media/contact-members-strategic-marketing-and-communications\">Strategic Marketing and Communications</a>, to make their filming request.  That office will work with Risk Management and University Counsel to evaluate the request.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Non-Temple (external) filmmakers interested in the <a href=\"../../../scrc\">Special Collections Research Center</a>, the <a href=\"../../../blockson\">Charles L. Blockson Afro American Collection</a>, and the <a href=\"../../../lcdss\">Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio</a> will need to contact the <a href=\"../../../people\">staff</a> responsible for those resources to determine the viability of filming.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Agreement for filming in Temple University Libraries</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You will need to review and agree to the following guidelines for yourself and the crew doing the filming.  </p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Guidelines</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You and the crew members agree to abide by the <a href=\"../../../policies/9\">Temple University Libraries Community Standards</a>. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You will provide a mobile phone number for the key contact on the crew.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Make sure all crew members bring their Temple OWLcards or set up <a href=\"https://finance.temple.edu/owlcard\">Mobile OWLcard</a> for their smartphones.  They will need their ID to enter the library.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you plan to use or do any filming in a study room, you must reserve the room in advance at <a href=\"https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/booking/charles-small\">https://charlesstudy.temple.edu/booking/charles-small</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 3rd-floor reading area (13th street side) and the entire 4th floor are quiet study spaces, so please make an effort to minimize the volume of noise during filming. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The crew will need to work with existing lighting.  The lighting in the library should not be altered or turned off.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Temple Library furniture needs to remain in its designated places. If tables, chairs, study desks, book carts, or trash cans are moved, please return them to their original location.  </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Any and all trash and recycling generated during filming will need to be disposed of in appropriate receptacles at the end of filming.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Content: The message of the film being made (not just the segment being filmed in the library) will not reflect poorly on Temple University.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Content: The message or import of the film will not have political endorsements.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Content: The film will not advocate explicitly or implicitly poor library or archival preservation or use practice.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Respect the privacy of researchers in the vicinity of filming.  Please allow researchers to access library materials.  </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You are restricted from filming or photographing anyone else in the Library who is not a part of your crew. If you are likely to capture someone incidentally as part of a scene shot, you must either get the students’ permission to be included or wait until the student(s) leave the area.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If anything changes in your plans you will contact the library via email (<a href=\"mailto:asktulibrary@temple.edu\">asktulibrary@temple.edu</a>) as soon as you can. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Approval and Notification</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When filming is approved, either by the Library administration for a student filmmaker, or by the University Communications and Counsel for external non-Temple (external) filmmakers, the details (location, date and time, and crew contact information) are communicated to the Libraries’ public services staff so that the personnel on duty on the appointed day are aware of the filming activity.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The filmmaker will be instructed to print out the approved filming agreement email from the Library Administration and keep a copy of it with the crew during the filming session.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"../../../forms/filming-request\">Filming Request Form</a></h2>",

An exception to this is controversial source material, which may be considered when accompanied by clarifying description and context.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Selection Criteria and Timeline</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anyone can request to hold an exhibit in Charles Library, but exhibits will be prioritized if they involve collaboration with library staff or resources. Outside groups are encouraged to find sponsorship from a Temple faculty member.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Priority is given to work that has a tie-in with library resources or the other goals outlined above.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We often plan our exhibit schedule a year or more in advance, so submitting requests at least six months before the proposed opening is preferred. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Requests for a library exhibit should be made by emailing <a href=\"mailto:libraries@temple.edu\">libraries@temple.edu</a>. Temple University Libraries reserve the right to refuse any request. </p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Preparing to Exhibit</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exhibitor takes responsibility for security and insurance for the exhibit, as well as for the preparation of the exhibit. The exhibitor must coordinate with library staff for installation and removal.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exhibitor also takes responsibility for the cost of the exhibit, which includes appropriate signage. A library staff member will work with the exhibitor to identify what kinds of signage and other explanatory materials are required.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Exhibits must not interfere with library operations and, aside from small holes for hanging materials, must not damage library property.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Security</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Temple University Libraries cannot guarantee the security of the exhibit or its materials; the exhibitor accepts all inherent risks to items that are not library collections or property. </p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Promotion</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exhibitor assumes responsibility for promotion, but library staff may include information about the exhibit on social media, the library website, and various print publications. </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The exhibition description provided in the exhibit request may be utilized by the Libraries for promotion.</p>",

Please email us at <u style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><a style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: #6c420e; text-decoration-line: none;\" href=\"mailto:scrc@temple.edu\">scrc@temple.edu</a></u> or call the SCRC reference desk at 215-204-5750.</p>\r\n<hr style=\"box-sizing: border-box; border-style: solid; border-color: gray; border-image: initial; height: 1px;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px;\">When processing (arranging, organizing, and describing) archival collections, and cataloging rare books, SCRC staff must make choices about what language to use when describing not just the books, papers, and records, but the people and organizations who created or who are represented in them. We recognize that many of our materials are created by and/or represent marginalized groups of people, and we believe it is our responsibility not only to describe those people and organizations accurately and respectfully, but to do so in a way that will not be harmful or offensive.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px;\">However, many of our finding aids (descriptions and inventories of collections) and library catalog records, which were created years or decades ago, may well include harmful language. SCRC is dedicated to revising and updating our descriptive language, but with hundreds of finding aids and thousands of library catalog records, this is ongoing and will take time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px;\">Additionally, when processing new collections we will occasionally re-use language provided by creators or former owners of the collection, either because it provides important context about the materials or because it is a way to make the collections available for research use more quickly. In book cataloging, it is a common practice for efficiency to re-use catalog records created by other libraries.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px;\">For both archival collections and books, we follow the standard practice of using Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) for better searching in our library catalog. We are aware that some LCSH terms are outdated and harmful, and we are supporting the various efforts underway throughout the library and archives profession to update and change these terms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px;\">For all these reasons, potentially harmful language may appear. SCRC staff are dedicated to balancing efficient and timely processing and cataloging, as well as preservation of original context, with an awareness of the importance of language and its effect on users of our materials and those represented within them. We recognize that we may not always make the right decision and welcome feedback from all sources so that we can learn and adjust our practices.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px;\">When processing new archival collections, SCRC archivists follow guidelines to reduce the appearance of language that may be hurtful or harmful to some. These guidelines include the following actions:</p>\r\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial;\">\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Actively weighing whether the efficiency or preservation of context from re-using or not remediating problematic and potentially offensive description is worth the affect it may have on users encountering that description.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial;\">\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Clearly indicating (through use of quotation marks, notes, or other explanation) what language comes from an external source or is legacy/older description, and which was written by SCRC staff.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial;\">\r\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\">Researching how the community describes itself and its own histories, finding other institutions that have grappled with similar collections, and/or discussing the issue directly with the people or organizations who created or are described by the materials.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 12px;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 10px;\">SCRC 2018.04</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"meta submitted\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-size: 0.857em; color: #68696b; margin-bottom: -5px; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #fefefe;\">\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 21px 0px 21px 14px;\">Last Updated: 10/10/2018</p>\r\n</div>",

        "description": "<h2>Background and Scope:</h2>\r\n<p>The Temple University Libraries are committed to ensuring the privacy of all library users, including students, faculty, staff and guests.   This policy applies to all resources regardless of their format or means of delivery as well as to all services offered by the Libraries.    Several laws and policies govern and inform library policy and procedure  in this area.  These include</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>the  “Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act” commonly known as FERPA, which applies to records pertaining to current and former students of Temple University and in general prevents release of information without written consent of the individual.    </li>\r\n<li>Pennsylvania Commonwealth Statute  24 P.S. § 4428, 2002, which mandates confidentiality of library circulation /use  records</li>\r\n<li>Temple University  policies concerning  privacy and information security</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In order to conform with these laws and policies we maintain strict user confidentiality and will not reveal the identities or  personally identifying information (“PII”)  of individual users or reveal what information resources they consult or services were provided those users  to any non-Libraries staff, individual, or entity without a court order or a valid subpoena, or under appropriate federal law.</p>\r\n<h2>Library Records:</h2>\r\n<p>Records of the borrowing and use of library information resources (a.k.a. library materials) and equipment are considered to be confidential,  as are the records of patron transactions of any type including, but not limited to reference interactions,  computer use logs, logs of Internet sites consulted, etc., as well as records of transactions regarding fees and fines.    For library purposes, this covers all records related to the circulation or use of ipads, digital cameras, and any other equipment loaned by the University Libraries as well as books and other formats of printed or electronic information available from the Libraries, including materials that are personally owned by a faculty member that have been placed on reserve for reading in a course or of special collections materials donated or on deposit at the Libraries.</p>\r\n<p>In the event a borrower incurs a financial obligation to the library, for example, for having failed to return a borrowed item, these financial records are also considered PII. </p>\r\n<h2>Collection and Security of PII</h2>\r\n<p>For certain defined business purposes the University Libraries  do collect PII which data are individually or collectively sensitive or confidential according to  current Temple University data classification.   Both sensitive information and confidential  information are  held in strict confidence and exchanged among library staff  or other University staff  only in relation  to the business purpose (i.e., on a need to know basis)  and only by appropriately secure means.  At all times PII  is to be secured in accordance with University policies and  for limited time periods defined by record retention  schedules. For example, the records of most circulation borrowing transactions are expunged and overwritten immediately upon  return to the libraries of the loaned items and thereafter are reflected only as anonymized statistics descriptive of overall borrowing patterns.   Records such as paper files of borrowing or use agreements not immediately expunged and destroyed  are held in secure locking conditions with limited access. </p>\r\n<p>Records containing PII which are scheduled for destruction shall be disposed of in accordance with University information security procedures.  Ordinarily this calls for paper records to be shredded and hard drives or other computer memory devices to be overwritten prior to  decommissioning or destruction. </p>\r\n<h3>Access by Library and University Staff to PII</h3>\r\n<p>PII collected is made accessible only to those specific individual staff who need access to the information in order to conduct library business or who will be compiling and anonymizing data for statistical or assessment purposes. </p>\r\n<p>It is the policy of the University Libraries that employee access to PII data collected or viewable in the Libraries shall be reviewed annually by supervisors and the library administrator designated as the Privacy and Security Liaison (Richie Holland, Director of Administration) and reported annually to Temple University’s Privacy Officer in accordance with Temple’s comprehensive Information Security program (policy 04.72.11) .  </p>\r\n<p>The Libraries designated Privacy and Security Liaison sends annual reminders to all library staff of the importance of maintaining confidentiality and charges library department heads to review these principles and privacy protocols with staff and student assistants in their respective departments. </p>\r\n<h3>Disclosure of PII</h3>\r\n<h4>Law Enforcement: </h4>\r\n<p>Any request for patron information that library staff may receive from a law enforcement official should be  immediately and directly referred to the Office of University Counsel, 300 Sullivan Hall, <a href=\"mailto:universitycounsel@temple.edu\">universitycounsel@temple.edu</a>, (215) 204-6524,  followed by notification to both the Dean of Libraries office and the cognizant library department head.      This applies to search warrants, subpoenas and other requests for information regarding our library users as well as an individual’s library records, etc.  This applies to all locations and all hours of service.   </p>\r\n<p>Information will be disclosed to law enforcement officials upon court order or valid subpoena,  as determined by University Counsel,  or in compliance with appropriate federal law without prior notice.</p>\r\n<h4>Others, including Parents: </h4>\r\n<p>Requests for patron information occasionally come from faculty or staff, other students, and parents. While it is not unlawful to make such a request, it would be unlawful for library staff to provide patron information or information about library business without proper authorization.     </p>\r\n<p>Examples of some typical questions that might be asked on the phone or at a service desk: </p>\r\n<p>“Can you tell me who has this book I desperately need to consult?  I will call them to arrange to quickly look at it.”     [Ans: “We are barred by state law from revealing who has borrowed our materials.”]</p>\r\n<p>“Can you tell me who  is recalling my book?  I’d like to know who else is working in this subject area.  I’d like to know if it’s a colleague of mine.” [Ans: “We are barred by state law from revealing who is making use of our materials.”]</p>\r\n<p>“I found a  book in the department lounge,   please tell me who has it  checked out so I can drop it  in their departmental mailbox . “   [Ans:   “Please return the book to the Library so that staff and take care of it confidentially.”]</p>\r\n<p>Parents of students occasionally inquire about student’s library fees or Bursar accounts and may ask what else was checked out to their daughter or son.  [Ans: “We are barred by state law from revealing  any borrowing  history or  financial history to persons other than the borrower and therefore  you should have your child  come to the library so we can discuss this with him/her directly. “]</p>\r\n<p>Instructors sometimes ask who in their classes checked out or viewed course reserves.
