        "description": "<p><strong>Note: The Fund has now been exhausted for 2020-2021. The Fund will open up again for applications in July 2021.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Open Access Publishing Fund supports faculty who would like to publish in an open access journal but do not have the funds to cover the article processing charge. </p>\r\n<p>The Libraries’ goal in starting the Open Access Publishing Fund is to promote new forms of scholarly communication. There are a number of high-quality open access publishers whose business model depends on the fees they collect from authors. Authors are increasingly interested in making their work available open access, as it helps them reach new and wider audiences. However, the costs involved can be a deterrent. We hope this Fund will help remove this financial barrier, encouraging authors to experiment with new and innovative publishing models. </p>\r\n<p>The Open Access Publishing Fund is open to all current Temple faculty members. Current postdoctoral fellows, residents, and graduate students may also apply, as long as there is at least one faculty member listed as a co-author on the article.</p>\r\n<h2>How to apply</h2>\r\n<p>Authors with a journal article that has been accepted or is under consideration by an open access publisher are encouraged to apply. Authors simply fill out a <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/scholarlycommunication/files/2020/06/OAPublishingFundApplication2020-2021.docx\">brief application form</a> with their information, a copy of the article, and a copy of the journal acceptance letter (if available). Funds are available on a first come, first served basis. The Libraries will aim to make a final decision regarding the application within two weeks’ time. If the request is approved, Libraries will transfer funds to authors’ research fund or departmental account. The Libraries cannot reimburse authors or pay publishers directly.</p>\r\n<h2>Applicant eligibility</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Applicants must be a current Temple University faculty member OR a current postdoctoral fellow/resident/graduate student with a faculty member listed as a co-author.</li>\r\n<li>Applicants with external grant funding that could cover, either in whole or in part, the cost of any publication and processing fees are ineligible.</li>\r\n<li>Applicants must agree to deposit a copy of their publication in our institutional repository, <a href=\"http://scholarshare.temple.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TUScholarShare</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Publication eligibility</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The publication must take the form of a peer-reviewed journal article.</li>\r\n<li>Many subscription journals now offer an open access option in which authors can choose to pay a fee to make their article open access. These publications are sometimes called “hybrid” open access journals. Articles in “hybrid” journals are not supported.</li>\r\n<li>The journal must be listed in the <a href=\"https://doaj.org/\">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> (DOAJ). The DOAJ is a community-curated online directory that indexes high quality, open access, peer-reviewed journals.</li>\r\n<li>The publisher must be a member of the <a href=\"https://oaspa.org/\">Open Access Scholarly Publishing Association</a> (OASPA), or clearly follow the membership criteria of the organization.</li>\r\n<li>Because the Libraries already cover 50% of the APC for <a href=\"https://www.biomedcentral.com/about/institutional-support/membership/1600019565\">BioMed Central journals</a>, these journals are not eligible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Additional stipulations</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each applicant may request up to $1,500 total per fiscal year. This amount may be split across multiple applications so long as funds are available.</li>\r\n<li>For articles with multiple Temple authors, the per article payment is capped at $3,000.</li>\r\n<li>Funding will cover publication and processing fees only. Funds may not be used for reprints, color illustration fees, non-open access page charges, permissions fees, web hosting for self-archiving, or other expenses not directly related to open access fees.</li>\r\n<li>Applicants whose article has already been accepted for publication must apply for funding within one month of official publisher acceptance.</li>\r\n<li>For applicants who have not yet submitted for publication, requests will be conditionally approved awaiting official acceptance by the publisher. All conditional approvals will expire six months after notification. Applicants must provide a copy of the acceptance letter before the invoice is processed.</li>\r\n<li>Fees are prorated for multi-authored articles. Co-authors from outside of Temple are not supported. If an article includes non-Temple authors, the APC will be divided equally among all authors and then the Temple authors’ portion will be funded. For example, if the APC is $2000, and there are four authors, two of whom are from Temple, the authors can apply for $1000 from the fund ($500 each).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Attribution requirement</h2>\r\n<p>Authors who receive support must include the following statement in their acknowledgements: Publication of this article was funded in part by the Temple University Libraries Open Access Publishing Fund.</p>",

Professor Ramella observed that student participation increased as a result of better preparedness for class.</p>\r\n<h3>Adapt</h3>\r\n<p>Jodi Levine-Laufgraben, from the Department of Higher Education saved students $30, for a total of $900 in her 30 person course in Fall 2016 by opting not to use a traditional textbook. Vice Provost Levine-Laufgraben carefully curated readings from multiple library resources and identified public domain, primary source documents such as Brown v. Board of Education and US congressional charters.</p>\r\n<h3>Create</h3>\r\n<p>Seth Bruggeman, from the Department of American History, assigned students a semester-long project researching the history of the Alfred E. Burk Mansion in North Philadelphia. This project was initiated with materials found in Temple University’s Special Collections Research Center. Students were tasked with drafting an updated statement of historical significance and imaging a new use for the vacant space. The class presented their findings to representatives from the administration. Students published blog posts throughout the semester that were made available on a course webpage that was publicly accessible.*</p>\r\n<p>The idea behind open assignments is to challenge the lifespan of traditional assignments that oftentimes end when the instructor assigns a grade. Instead, open assignments shift the utility of students’ effort and work away from a grade toward a public good. An open assignment focuses on reusing, remixing, and revising information by redistributing that information for further reach.</p>\r\n<p>*Professor Bruggeman’s course was not part of the Textbook Affordability Project.</p>\r\n<h3>Support</h3>\r\n<p>If you are seeking additional examples and support, please reach out to the subject specialist librarian serving your discipline.

        "description": "<h2>Past Recipients</h2>\r\n<h3>2018-2019 Award Year</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Marcus Bingenheimer</strong>, associate professor in the Department of Religion, is focusing on creating a foundational dataset for the dynamic historical social network analysis of Chinese Buddhist history. The dataset will enable historians of East Asian Buddhism to use social network analysis methods as part of their research and teaching.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Gabriel Kaprielian</strong>, assistant professor in Architecture, is developing an interactive website which examines the past, present, and future effects of sea level rise upon reclaimed land and urban shorelines.  Focused on the intersection of architecture and city planning, his work seeks to illuminate the critical importance of the social, cultural, and political issues facing waterfronts in global cities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Kimberley Williams</strong>, associate professor of Anthropology, is a bioarchaeologist whose digital project is in coordination with her field work in Oman. While documenting with 360 video the process of digging in the field, she will be using photogrammetry to recreate 3D models of artefacts relating to prehistoric mortuary rituals and funerary landscape formations. She also intends to share her work publicly through a digital collection online.</p>\r\n<h3>2017-2018 Award Year</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Roderick Coover</strong> is Professor and Director of the DAER &amp; DAVR Programs and Co-Director of the MA Program. His work examines the impact of new technologies in the humanities and arts. His films and new-media works include Unknown Territories (2011), Vérité to Virtual (DER, 2008), The Theory of Time Here (Video Data Bank, 2007), and Cultures in Webs (Eastgate, 2003), among others. As a DSC Faculty fellowship recipient in 2017-2018, Rod worked on the multimedia arts and sciences project Altering Shores. The project concerns land-use and climate change in the Delaware River estuary and its tributaries. During this research period, he produced three important new works that integrated historical and map-based studies with location-based field studies on land use and climate change. The year culminated in the premiere exhibition of two of the original works at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education and the presentation of original research at the University of Pennsylvania. These presentations also contributed to his receiving the award at the University of Pennsylvania to further the multi-stage project. Additional aspects of this research have led to papers and presentations in Asia, Europe and the USA. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Seher Edrogan</strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Architecture department at Tyler School of Art. She is an architect and the co-founder of EFFO, a design and research practice based in Philadelphia. Her research deals with the visual and multimedia representation of architectural heritage sites through the lens of material culture. During her fellowship at the DSC in the 2017-18 academic year, she advanced her work on a virtual 3D reconstruction project of the 5th century Byzantine Church of Stoudius, later converted to the Mosque of Imrahor by the Ottomans, in present-day Istanbul, Turkey. In collaboration with a VR technologist and interactive designers, she developed a prototypical immersive environment, in which virtual visitors can navigate the building and discover the layers of transformation the architecture has undergone over the course of 16 centuries. This layered interactive experience is delivered through a set of embedded multimedia annotations, which contain textual, visual, and audio content, and functions as an epistemological device revealing the interpretive nature of visual and spatial representation of an historical artifact based on uncertain and at times conflicting data. The prototypical phase of the project completed during the fellowship will be disseminated through invited book chapters in Design, History and Time: New Temporalities in a Digital Age, ed. Zoë Hendon and Anne Massey (Bloomsbury, February 2019) and in Imagined Forms: The Material Culture of Modeling, ed. Martin Brueckner, Sandy Isenstadt, and Sarah Wasserman (The University of Minnesota Press, forthcoming in 2020).</p>\r\n<h3>2016-2017 Award Year</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Adrienne Shaw</strong>, Assistant Professor in the Department of Media Studies and Production, focuses on the history of LGBTQ representation in games. During her faculty fellowship, Dr. Adrienne Shaw worked on the LGBTQ Game Archive, an online database collecting information on all known LGBTQ content in digital games from the 1980s until today (<a href=\"http://www.lgbtqgamearchive.com/\">www.lgbtqgamearchive.com</a>). When the project started in 2015, the master list included 150 games and now totals over 1200. With assistance from the DSC Dr. Shaw worked specifically on a related project that entailed digitally archiving the primary materials used for the research on each game. By creating an Omeka database and corresponding hard drive or original research materials, she can ensure the information about these games and instances of content are saved for posterity at The Strong Museum of Play in Rochester New York. The structure for both were completed during the DSC fellowship year, and the following year a collaborator at Central Michigan University (Cody Mejeur) was able to develop a script to automatically process the rest of the materials. The Omeka site will launch and the hard drive will be available at The Strong in the Spring of 2019. This work also served as the basis for RAINBOW ARCADE, a first of it’s kind exhibit on the history of LGBTQ video game content, that will open at the Schwules Museum in Berlin on December 13, 2019. Finally, she gave 8 invited talks and 7 conference presentations, as well as published one journal article and two book chapters related to the project during and immediately after the fellowship.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Colin Chamberlain</strong>, assistant professor of philosophy, spent the academic year with the DSC building skills in the area of stylometric textual analysis so he could apply it to the work of Descartes. This allowed Dr. Chamberlain to test a hypothesis about reliability, stylistic convergence and the narrative voice. Colin also used what he learnt as an abstract for conference presentations and a draft paper.</p>",

This is so shared data can be re-used in future research, replicated to ensure validity, and be accessible to the public.</p>\r\n<p>Procedures for sharing data should be covered in the Data Management Plan (DMP) submitted with the grant application. This should include where data will be deposited for sharing and outline any necessary costs to curating and preparing the data.</p>\r\n<p>NSF: If you received an award based on a proposal submitted, or due, on or after January 25, 2016, you are required to include <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2017/nsf17060/nsf17060.jsp#q15\">a data sharing plan in your DMP</a>.</p>\r\n<p>NIH: If your award is $500,000 or more for direct costs, you are expected to <a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.2.3_sharing_research_resources.htm#Data\">address data sharing in your DMP</a>. </p>\r\n<p>There may also be specific requirements based on the directorate or institute issuing the grant. <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp\">NSF</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/NIHbmic/nih_data_sharing_policies.html\">NIH</a>. </p>\r\n<p>The following resources and tools can help you share, publish, cite and preserve your research data.</p>\r\n<h2>Places to share and preserve your data</h2>\r\n<p>To make your data more accessible, you can deposit it in a general or discipline-specific repository.

        "description": "<p>The Cultural Analytics Certificate curriculum begins with an introductory course that surveys the full range of current research methods in the field, so that students are aware of the different techniques they can apply to their own research questions. This survey is followed by two electives selected from a list of courses that represent the distinct methodological emphases in the field, giving students a chance to gain a solid understanding of the conceptual and technical material they need to master.</p>\r\n<p>The concluding experience is a practicum in which students complete a research project for the dissertation, thesis, or culminating event. The workshop is overseen by staff from the Scholars Studio of Temple Libraries. This facility has both the equipment and the technical expertise to guide students in the process of completing their projects, and the workshop format gives all participating students a community to work with during the process.</p>\r\n<p>Because this final project is intended as part of their graduate program, students are required to work closely with their academic adviser. Both the practicum director and academic adviser must assign a passing grade to the final project for successful completion of the certificate program.</p>\r\n<h2>Certificate Courses</h2>\r\n<h3>Required Core Courses</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/courses/cla/\">CLA 5019 -- Introduction to Cultural Analytics</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/history-phd/#courseinventory\">HIST 51521 -- Digital History</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://bulletin.temple.edu/courses/mmc/\">MMC 9087 -- Cultural Analytics Practicum</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Note: Students can choose between CLA 5019 or History 51521.

        "description": "<h2>General Questions:</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What is an institutional repository?</strong></p>\r\n<p>An institutional repository (IR) is a digital archive for compiling, storing and sharing an institution’s academic and research output. TUScholarShare is Temple’s institutional repository.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. Do I have to register an account or login to be able to use TUScholarShare or deposit content?</strong></p>\r\n<p>As part of our service, TUScholarShare staff will deposit your work on your behalf when you select one of our <a href=\"../../../services/deposit-services\">deposit services</a>. There is no need for you to register an account or login.</p>\r\n<p>TUScholarShare’s content is freely accessible to anyone on the World Wide Web. Users may download and use works in TUScholarShare in any manner consistent with fair use, as per the license terms and conditions chosen by the copyright owner.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. How long before my work is available in the repository?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Deposits via the <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/scholarshare/quick-deposit-form/\">Quick Deposit Form</a> will usually be available in the repository within 1-2 weeks of receipt. If you place a <a href=\"https://sites.temple.edu/scholarshare/cv-review-form/\">CV Review Request</a>, please allow for 3-4 weeks for TUScholarShare staff to complete the review process.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: What is ORCID?</strong></p>\r\n<p>ORCID is a way for scholars to uniquely identify themselves and their work from others, differentiating you from others with similar names and research. It allows repositories and databases to let users easily access all the work of one author. We encourage all Temple researchers to register for an ORCID iD at <a href=\"https://orcid.org/\">orcid.org</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Share your ORCID id with us when you deposit content to TUScholarShare and we will display your ORCID iD badge next to your name as author of the work.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q: How do I search for and access works deposited in TUScholarShare?</strong></p>\r\n<p>TUScholarShare allows users to search for works or browse through collections. It includes a search feature that allows users to look for items by author, title, date or subject. TUScholarShare is also indexed by leading search engines and metadata aggregators, such as Google Scholar.</p>\r\n<h2>Publishing:</h2>\r\n<table style=\"width:100%;border-collapse:collapse;border-style:none;height:436px;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"height:35px;background-color:#eeee;\"><strong>Q.

        "description": "<p>Thank you for your interest in visiting Charles Library with your group or organization.</p>\r\n<p>Temple University Libraries is able to accommodate certain types of requests for group visits and/or tours. Availability depends on the specific goal of the visit, the time of the year, the size of the group, and other variables. Please read the information below and fill out the <a href=\"../../../forms/group-visit\">Group Visit form</a> to inquire about a visit with your group or to request a tour for a specific date and time.</p>\r\n<p>For general access to Charles Library, see our <a href=\"../../policies/6\">public entrance policy</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>Our Policy for Visits</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>We welcome visits from any type of groups, including professional organizations and clubs.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>All group tour requests and/or school visits must be arranged through the <a href=\"../../../forms/group-visit\">Group Visit form</a>, with the exception of <a href=\"../58\">requests for instruction &amp; class visits to the Special Collections Research Center</a>.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Requests for visits must be made a minimum of two weeks in advance of the visit date.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Group size: the ideal size for a tour group is 12–15 people. We may be able to accommodate multiple groups this size from a single organization depending on staff availability.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Special Guidelines for School Visits To Temple Libraries</h2>\r\n<p>Instructors or group leaders may be interested in bringing their students to visit Charles Library, the main library of Temple University Libraries, to expose their students to a research university library. In cases where there is no specific assignment, we offer limited learning/instructional opportunities for student visits.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Per our general library access policy, anyone under the age of 18, must be accompanied by a parent or guardian while on library premises. Student groups must be accompanied by their instructor or an adult chaperone throughout the visit, as well as library staff. </p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>The primary audience for a general visit is students in grades 9–12 (high school level), but K–8 groups are also welcome.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Meeting the needs of our Temple students and faculty during the academic year is our first priority. Therefore visits to Charles Library are generally available only between May 15 and June 15. Between September and April visits may be possible, subject to availability.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Each tour lasts approximately 60 minutes with time for questions. Depending on the needs of the group, a demonstration of the Libraries' digital research resources could be arranged. Please inquire about this.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Computer Access: Owing to Temple University computer security policies we cannot provide student groups with access to computers, printers, scanners, the Internet, or any of our licensed electronic resources. If individual students are interested in using a computer at Charles Library, he or she may return to apply for a guest computer user card. Students must come to the Charles Library One Stop Assistance desk with a parent or guardian who will co-sign their computer user application. A student under 18 who obtains computer privileges must still be accompanied by a parent or guardian when using a computer.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Book lending:  Temple University Libraries offer students (Pennsylvania only) in grades 9–12 the privilege of borrowing books. Students must come to the Charles Library One Stop Assistance desk with a parent or guardian who will co-sign their guest borrowing application and be financially responsible for all materials borrowed. All applications to become a book borrower go through a screening process that can take up to two weeks, so we are not able to provide a borrower's card at the time of application.  Please be advised that we cannot provide entire tour groups with guest borrowing privileges during a single visit.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",

        "description": "<h2>Adopt</h2>\r\n<p>Daniele Ramella, from the Department of Chemistry, replaced a $238 Molecular Chemistry textbook in a course of fifty students with a freely accessible, open textbook from OpenStax. Professor Ramella saved students $11,900 in the Fall 2016- Spring 2017 academic year. Professor Ramella observed that student participation increased as a result of better preparedness for class.</p>\r\n<h2>Adapt</h2>\r\n<p>Jodi Levine-Laufgraben, from the Department of Higher Education saved students $30, for a total of $900 in her 30 person course in Fall 2016 by opting not to use a traditional textbook. Vice Provost Levine-Laufgraben carefully curated readings from multiple library resources and identified public domain, primary source documents such as Brown v. Board of Education and US congressional charters.</p>\r\n<h2>Create</h2>\r\n<p>Seth Bruggeman, from the Department of American History, assigned students a semester-long project researching the history of the Alfred E. Burk Mansion in North Philadelphia. This project was initiated with materials found in Temple University’s Special Collections Research Center. Students were tasked with drafting an updated statement of historical significance and imaging a new use for the vacant space. The class presented their findings to representatives from the administration. Students published blog posts throughout the semester that were made available on a course webpage that was publicly accessible.*</p>\r\n<p>The idea behind open assignments is to challenge the lifespan of traditional assignments that oftentimes end when the instructor assigns a grade. Instead, open assignments shift the utility of students’ effort and work away from a grade toward a public good. An open assignment focuses on reusing, remixing, and revising information by redistributing that information for further reach.</p>\r\n<p>*Professor Bruggeman’s course was not part of the Textbook Affordability Project.</p>\r\n<h2>Support</h2>\r\n<p>If you are seeking additional examples and support, please reach out to the <a href=\"../../people?page=1&amp;specialists=true\">subject specialist librarian</a> serving your discipline.
